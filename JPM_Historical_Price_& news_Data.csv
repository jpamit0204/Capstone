Three out of 4 businesses ÃÂÃÂ 76% of midsize companies and 74% of small ones ÃÂÃÂ are optimistic about their own performance, and the majority expect to grow sales this year (70% of midsize companies and 62% of small ones). TheyÃÂÃÂre leaning into this expected growth through measures including more widespread adoption of new technology and increased hiring. The national and global business outlooks are more cautious, with midsize companies in particular reporting a drop in optimism from 2019. While more than half of midsize (59%) and small (52%) businesses remain optimistic about the national economy, this marks a decline of 14 and 3 points from a year ago, respectively. Optimism about the global economy is also down for midsize companies, which are more likely to have exposure to international markets: 24% are optimistic compared to 39% in 2019. Among small businesses, global optimism is steady at 40% compared to 38% in 2019. ÃÂÃÂBusinesses are becoming used to a new normal as the pace of economic expansion naturally settles down,ÃÂÃÂ said Jim Glassman, senior economist at JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂBut itÃÂÃÂs important to note that slowing economic growth isnÃÂÃÂt a sign of weakness, and many of the concerns business leaders have point toward an economy thatÃÂÃÂs running at its full potential.ÃÂÃÂ Leaning into Disruption: When it comes to preparing for disruption, even more business leaders are mobilizing to make changes now compared to 2019: 89% of midsize companies and 61% of small ones report taking actions including purchasing cyber insurance, creating contingency plans and designating individuals and teams to identify threats and opportunities. Businesses are also embracing emerging technologies to increase efficiencies and reach customers more directly. For midsize businesses, cloud computing is expected to be the most widely deployed technology for 2020, with 73% planning to use it, followed by data-driven targeted marketing (50%) and application programming interfaces (APIs) at 46%. Small businesses are increasingly feeling the impacts of e-commerce disruption, but 57% feel confident in their ability to manage this challenge. ÃÂÃÂIn an era of rapid technological change, businesses are demonstrating their resiliency and taking steps to future-proof their companies,ÃÂÃÂ said John Simmons, head of Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries at JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂHarnessing new tools and technologies and remaining agile will help accelerate growth in todayÃÂÃÂs competitive environment.ÃÂÃÂ Hiring from a Shrinking Talent Pool: Businesses want to hire to prepare for an expected uptick in sales, but a limited supply of qualified candidates is making it increasingly difficult to do so. For the second consecutive year, midsize businesses rank this as the #1 challenge, constrained by a lack of applicants and unique skills needed for the job. This is a reality for small businesses as well: 31% report that they are extremely or very concerned about the candidate supply, up from 28% last year. Still, businesses are forging ahead: 55% of midsize businesses and 39% of small ones expect to increase full-time employees over the next year. Small businesses also expect a jump in part-time employment, with 38% planning to hire, up 7 percentage points from 2019. To retain talent, businesses plan to increase compensation, improve benefits and provide flexible hours. Setting Sights on Business Abroad: Despite geopolitical and trade-related concerns, midsize businesses remain heavily invested overseas and are continuing to expand into new international markets at earlier stages in their lifecycles. Nearly half (47%) of midsize businesses have sales outside the U.S., with an additional 14% planning to establish international sales or operations in the next three years. Unexpected Growth is Common: Many small businesses (69%) report having experienced unexpected growth and of these companies, 91% have gone through it more than once. While small business leaders feel largely positive about the growth, they acknowledge having to work longer hours and purchase more supplies and inventory as a result. ÃÂÃÂUnexpected growth is a good problem to have but it can be stressful for small business owners,ÃÂÃÂ said Business Banking CEO Jen Roberts. ÃÂÃÂThey have to reassess their short and long-term strategies, which could mean managing their cash flow more efficiently, incentivizing staff, or investing in technology to help them scale.ÃÂÃÂ Planning For the New Decade: Businesses should get comfortable with todayÃÂÃÂs complex operating environment, and keep the following considerations in mind as they plan for the year ahead: For more information on the Business Leaders Outlook, please view the midsize and small business reports. Survey Methodology JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from October 7 to 15, 2019, for small businesses (annual revenues between $100,000 and $20 million) and from October 29 to November 19, 2019, for middle market companies (annual revenues between $20 million and $500 million). In total, more than 1,800 business leaders in various industries across the U.S. participated in the survey. For year-over-year trends, current data is compared to data collected in the first quarter of previous years. The results of this online survey are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is plus or minus 2.5% for the small business findings and plus or minus 3.3% for the midsize business findings, both at the 95% confidence level.

Morgan (NYSE:JPM) announced the launch of a program that sources, funds and supports female founded companies seeking to disrupt existing markets. This initiative aims to close the gender-based funding gap by providing female founders in technology greater access to capital, networking opportunities and advisory services of a world class bank. The Vinetta Project and J.P. Morgan have designed a program featuring a series of prestigious events, including showcase pitch events, problem-hacking cohort, half-day bootcamp and much more. Exceptional female founded tech companies can apply to participate by clicking here. ÃÂÃÂIn 2019, venture capital investment in all-female founding teams reached a record $3.3 billion, representing 2.8% of capital invested across the entire U.S. startup ecosystem. While this is an increase from 2018, we are determined to raise market awareness around gender inequality and build stronger mentorship networks to help female founders achieve growth and long-term success,ÃÂÃÂ said Vanessa Dawson, founder and CEO of The Vinetta Project. ÃÂÃÂWorking with a leading organization like J.P. Morgan, we maximize our value offering to female-founded companies and accelerate our shared mission to close the gender-based funding gap.ÃÂÃÂ Since being founded in 2016, The Vinetta Project has become the leading ecosystem and deal flow pipeline supporting early stage female founders. With more than 4,000 female founders and 10,000 community members, the Vinetta programming has helped to facilitate the flow of more than $240 million in early-stage venture funding to seed-stage technology startups. Working in collaboration with J.P. Morgan, this program significantly expands network access for female founders across the following four capital pillars that are critical to success: financial capital, personal capital, intellectual capital and social capital. ÃÂÃÂThis program reinforces our ongoing commitment to fuel female ambition and advance financial equality, as exemplified by our Women on the Move program, which expanded to serve our clients in 2018,ÃÂÃÂ said Sam Saperstein, Head of Women on the Move at JPMorgan Chase & Co. ÃÂÃÂWith a shared mission to help female-led companies succeed, we are excited to work with The Vinetta Project and invest in capabilities that achieve greater inclusivity in the growing innovation economy.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂBy joining forces with The Vinetta Project, we can bring the depth of J.P.

The majority of business leaders remain hopeful in the face of adversity: while most (83%) are running at a reduced capacity, 68% are confident their businesses will thrive and just 2% are concerned their businesses may not survive. Looking ahead to the next six months, more than half of business leaders (56%) are optimistic about their companies, but confidence dwindles on broader levels. Approximately one in three respondents are optimistic about the local economy (33%) and national economy (35%), while confidence in the global economy is considerably lower at 17%. ÃÂÃÂItÃÂÃÂs been incredible to witness the resilience, flexibility and innovation of AmericaÃÂÃÂs businesses during an extraordinarily difficult year for all people around the world,ÃÂÃÂ said Jim Glassman, head economist, JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking. ÃÂÃÂFrom speaking with business leaders across the country, itÃÂÃÂs clear that some of the most agile companies are gaining market share, particularly in industries like technology and e-commerce.ÃÂÃÂ As a result of this yearÃÂÃÂs disruptions, these are the top five actions business leaders are taking: Conserving capital for unforeseen needs: Most business leaders (87%) have already built up their cash reserves or plan to do so in the next three months. Not surprisingly, 71% have either reduced their spending on capital expenditures or are planning to do so. Learning from the crisis: With continued uncertainty around economic conditions and a potential second wave of COVID-19, 82% of businesses have already prepared or are planning to prepare for a similar event in the future. Managing business finances digitally: The majority of business leaders (59%) have either already increased or plan to increase their use of digital banking and treasury management tools to manage cash flow, send and receive payments, and streamline operations. Implementing permanent changes to operating models: As a result of implementing remote working capabilities, more than half (56%) of business leaders have already made permanent changes to their operating models or plan to do so in the next three months. Shifting the business online: More than half (54%) of business leaders have also shifted their operating models to be more online or plan to do so, as a result of pandemic-related closures and shifting consumer habits. While many business leaders are cautiously optimistic about the future, theyÃÂÃÂre faced with the realities of an unpredictable operating environment. Their top three challenges are: Uncertain economic conditions: The vast majority of business leaders surveyed (70%) cited economic uncertainty ÃÂÃÂ both domestically and globally ÃÂÃÂ as the leading challenge facing their business operations. Revenue and sales growth: 59% of business leaders are concerned about growing sales, though with certain industries seeing an uptick in demand, 47% reported that theyÃÂÃÂre expecting an increase in revenue and sales within the next six months. Shifting consumer habits due to COVID-19: The pandemic accelerated a behavioral shift of consumers leaning in to e-commerce technology for purchasing, in addition to spending more conservatively overall. Changing consumer habits is a leading concern for 33% of business leaders. Businesses should keep the following considerations top-of-mind in navigating the remainder of the year: Harness the power of workplace technology. COVID-19 has accelerated the evolution of remote working, and now is the time for businesses to implement digital tools to enhance productivity. Learn more here. Enhance digital security protocols.

Smith Reminds Investors of Looming Deadline in the Class Action Lawsuit Against JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM),"BENSALEM, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Law Offices of Howard G. Smith reminds investors of the upcoming December 23, 2020 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the case filed on behalf of investors who purchased JP Morgan Chase & Co. (ÃÂÃÂJPMorganÃÂÃÂ or the ÃÂÃÂCompanyÃÂÃÂ) (NYSE: JPM) securities between February 23, 2016 and September 23, 2020, inclusive (the ÃÂÃÂClass PeriodÃÂÃÂ). Investors suffering losses on their JPMorgan investments are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 888-638-4847 or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com. On November 6, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") announced in a press release that former JPMorgan precious metals trader John Edmonds had pled guilty to commodities fraud and spoofing conspiracyÃÂÃÂi.e., placing larger orders with no intention of executing, thereby creating an artificial impression of high demand or supply of the commodity in question. On August 20, 2019, the DOJ then announced that another JPMorgan employee, Christian Trunz, pled guilty to spoofing charges, admitting that he had learned to spoof from more senior traders and had engaged in spoofing with the knowledge and consent of his supervisors. On September 23, 2020, Bloomberg reported that the Company was nearing a settlement to resolve the spoofing charges, stating that JPMorgan was ""poised to pay close to $1 billion."" On this news, JPMorgan's stock price fell $2.04 per share, or 2.15%, to close at $92.74 per share on September 23, 2020. On September 29, 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission formally announced that it had ordered JPMorgan to pay $920 million to settle spoofing and market manipulation charges. The complaint filed alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the CompanyÃÂÃÂs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) traders at the Company, with the knowledge and consent of their superiors, manipulated the precious metals market by ""spoofing,"" or placing fake orders to generate the appearance of market demand; (2) the Company had insufficient controls and compliance protocols to enable it to identify and stop the misconduct; (3) the Company's earnings in the physical commodity market were, at least in part, ill-gotten; (4) such conduct would result in enhanced regulatory scrutiny; (5) the Company provided misleading information to CFTC investigators at early stages of the investigation into the misconduct; (6) resolution of the governmental investigation into the Company would result in a record-breaking $920 million fine; and (7) as a result, Defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired JPMorgan securities, you may move the Court no later than December 23, 2020 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff if you meet certain legal requirements. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.

In collaboration with other organisations, including the London Community Foundation, the firm will help boost the ability of local nonprofit organisations to deal with the increased demand for their services since the onset of COVID-19. This collaboration aims to help remove barriers to opportunity for Black and ethnic minority communities by strengthening organisations that focus on jobs and skills, small business growth and financial health. ÃÂÃÂThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on the health and finances of Black and ethnic minority communities, highlighting and exacerbating structural barriers to economic opportunity,ÃÂÃÂ said Viswas Raghavan, CEO of J.P. Morgan in EMEA. ÃÂÃÂAs part of our global commitment to racial equity, JPMorgan Chase is focused on helping develop local, community-driven solutions to help historically underserved Londoners share in the benefits of an inclusive economy.ÃÂÃÂ Structural barriers in the U.K. have created profound racial inequalities that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While over half of white groups reported that they had not been affected financially by the coronavirus crisis, only a third of Black and minority ethnic (BME) people said the same. Research shows that BME people are more likely to have found it harder than usual to pay for essentials, meet basic needs (12% BME vs 8% white groups) and pay bills or rent (15% BME vs 8% white groups). JPMorgan Chase and the London Community Foundation are looking to collaborate with organisations with Black and ethnic minority leaders to design and implement a programme that helps address economic disparity in a targeted and meaningful way. This effort is focused on strengthening local nonprofit organisations that are on the frontlines of addressing the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities. ÃÂÃÂThis is an important initiative for LondonÃÂÃÂs communities as it seeks to invest in both BME-led frontline organisations, providing vital employment and financial health support, as well as the organisations that can support their resilience and voice,ÃÂÃÂ said Kate Markey, CEO of London Community Foundation. ÃÂÃÂLCF is delighted to be partnering with J.P. Morgan on the programme at this time.ÃÂÃÂ This commitment builds on the approach JPMorgan Chase has taken in its support of London Youth to help 15 youth clubs across London empower young people. This increases their employability by building their skills and connecting them with employers. ÃÂÃÂBuilding out our capacity to deliver employability support has allowed us to be more impactful in helping the young people who come to our club,ÃÂÃÂ said Syed Uddin, Head if Operations at Leaders in Community Youth Club in East London. ÃÂÃÂWe are now better able to work with them to pursue their career and education goals. We have been able to exchange ideas with other youth clubs, train staff to offer relevant advice and guidance, access better employability resources online, introduce a skills development framework and use new digital tools for virtual career insight and work experience opportunities.ÃÂÃÂ A Commitment to Racial Equity This new effort follows a $30 billion commitment by JPMorgan Chase to advance racial equity through its expertise in business, policy and philanthropy. The commitment will focus on promoting and expanding affordable housing and homeownership, growing Black and ethnic-minority owned small businesses, improving financial health and access to banking, and building a more diverse and inclusive workplace. In the U.K., through its Advancing Black Pathways Programme, the firm has a history of investing in the careers of Black students and leaders. About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Unter der Marke ÃÂÃÂChaseÃÂÃÂ wird die Bank Produkte und Funktionen anbieten, die auf die BedÃÂÃÂ¼rfnisse der Kunden in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien zugeschnitten sind. Diese werden ÃÂÃÂ¼ber eine innovative mobile App bereitgestellt. ÃÂÃÂWir von Chase siedeln uns in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien an, weil wir unseren Kunden ein neues Bankangebot unterbreiten mÃÂÃÂ¶chten, das es ihnen ermÃÂÃÂ¶glicht, einen einfach zu handhabenden, auÃÂÃÂergewÃÂÃÂ¶hnlichen Bankservice zu nutzen, der auf dem bedeutenden LeistungsvermÃÂÃÂ¶gen von JPMorgan Chase basiertÃÂÃÂ, so Gordon Smith, CEO des Unternehmensbereichs Consumer & Community Banking und Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂIn GroÃÂÃÂbritannien ist das PrivatkundengeschÃÂÃÂ¤ft im Banksektor ein dynamischer, hart umkÃÂÃÂ¤mpfter Markt. Deshalb haben wir diese Bank von Grund auf neu konzipiert, um sie speziell auf die BedÃÂÃÂ¼rfnisse der hiesigen Kunden zuzuschneiden.ÃÂÃÂ Sanoke Viswanathan wurde zum CEO der neuen digitalen Bank ernannt. Zuvor war er als Chief Administrative Officer und Head of Strategy bei der Unternehmenskunden- und Investmentbank von JP Morgan tÃÂÃÂ¤tig. Die digitale Bank hat ihren Hauptsitz im Londoner GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftsviertel Canary Wharf. Ihre Kunden werden von einem eigens dafÃÂÃÂ¼r gegrÃÂÃÂ¼ndeten Kundenkontaktcenter im schottischen Edinburgh betreut. Das Unternehmen hat bereits 400 Stellen in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien geschaffen und plant mit dem Wachstum der Bank weitere Einstellungen. Ein in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien ansÃÂÃÂ¤ssiges Tochterunternehmen von JPMorgan Chase besitzt die Lizenz fÃÂÃÂ¼r den Betrieb der Bank. Seine AktivitÃÂÃÂ¤ten werden von der britischen AufsichtsbehÃÂÃÂ¶rde Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) und von der britischen FinanzmarktaufsichtsbehÃÂÃÂ¶rde Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reguliert. Chase steht vor der einmaligen Chance, britischen Verbrauchern einen hÃÂÃÂ¶heren Mehrwert zu bieten, indem das Unternehmen die Sicherheit einer etablierten, vertrauenswÃÂÃÂ¼rdigen Bank mit einem nahtlosen Kundenservice kombiniert. Die Bank beabsichtigt, vielfÃÂÃÂ¤ltige Produkte anzubieten. ZunÃÂÃÂ¤chst soll ein neues Konzept fÃÂÃÂ¼r Girokonten vorgestellt werden. Das in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien ansÃÂÃÂ¤ssige Kundenkontaktcenter von Case wird eine entscheidende Rolle einnehmen sowie einen schnellen Zugriff und persÃÂÃÂ¶nlichen Service rund um die Uhr anbieten. Bevor das Angebot der ÃÂÃÂffentlichkeit bereitgestellt wird, wird es derzeit in einer internen Pilotphase getestet. ÃÂÃÂUnsere Entscheidung, eine digitale Privatkundenbank in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien zu grÃÂÃÂ¼nden, ist von groÃÂÃÂer Bedeutung und stellt dem britischen Verbraucher zum ersten Mal unsere Privatkundenprodukte zur VerfÃÂÃÂ¼gungÃÂÃÂ, so Daniel Pinto, der in London ansÃÂÃÂ¤ssige Co-President von JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂDieses neue Vorhaben unterstreicht unser Engagement in einem Land, in dem wir tief verwurzelt sind, in dem Tausende von Mitarbeitern fÃÂÃÂ¼r uns tÃÂÃÂ¤tig sind und in dem wir seit ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 160 Jahren Niederlassungen betreiben.ÃÂÃÂ Als das Unternehmen den Markteintritt in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien in Betracht zog, fÃÂÃÂ¼hrte es umfangreiche Untersuchungen durch, um festzustellen, in welchen Bereichen es fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Verbraucher interessante Angebote machen und deren BedÃÂÃÂ¼rfnisse erfÃÂÃÂ¼llen kann. Auch wenn das digitale Banking mittlerweile Teil des Mainstreams ist, gelangte man bei der Bank zu der Erkenntnis, dass die StabilitÃÂÃÂ¤t und die VertrauenswÃÂÃÂ¼rdigkeit des Bankanbieters fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Verbraucher nach wie vor eine wichtige Rolle spielen. In den USA ist Chase eine der grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂÃÂten Privatkundenbanken, die beinahe die HÃÂÃÂ¤lfte aller Haushalte des Landes bedient, darunter auch 55 Millionen digital aktive Kunden. Das Bankhaus bietet eine breite Palette von Bankprodukten fÃÂÃÂ¼r Privatkunden an und nimmt in mehreren Bereichen Spitzenpositionen ein, u. a. beim EinlagengeschÃÂÃÂ¤ft, beim digitalen Banking und bei der Ausgabe von Kreditkarten.

(NYSE: JPM) ist ein fÃÂÃÂ¼hrender globaler Anbieter von Finanzdienstleistungen, der Niederlassungen in aller Welt unterhÃÂÃÂ¤lt und ein VermÃÂÃÂ¶gen im Umfang von 3,4 Billionen US-Dollar verwaltet.

The firm also joined a group of 29 major employers and national organizations to launch the Second Chance Business Coalition (SCBC) as part of its commitment to give people with criminal backgrounds a second chance by supporting their reentry into the workforce, community and local economies. Based on lessons learned from its efforts in Chicago, JPMorgan Chase is launching new collaborations with Columbus-based non-profit organizations to further build an inclusive hiring pipeline for people with criminal backgrounds in the city, whose histories fit within industry regulatory guidelines. The firm is collaborating with Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), Goodwill Columbus, Columbus Urban League and The Legal Aid Society of Columbus to provide these job seekers with key resources, such as legal services, job search support and mentorship. Since its launch, this firmÃÂÃÂs proven Second Chance recruitment model has helped more people with criminal backgrounds get hired into the firmÃÂÃÂs Chicago workforce. In Columbus, JPMorgan Chase will provide local partnering nonprofits with technical support to equip them with best-in-practice approaches to supporting jobseekers facing barriers to jobs because of their arrest or conviction histories. The organizations will collaborate with JPMorgan Chase recruiters to provide career coaching, mock interviews, resume building, skills assessments and wraparound services to help successfully recruit, hire, and retain people recruited through this effort. ÃÂÃÂNow more than ever, Central Ohio needs an economy that works for more people,ÃÂÃÂ said Corrine Burger, Chief Control Officer and Columbus Location Leader for JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂBreaking down barriers to employment not only helps connect businesses with qualified workers, but also unlocks opportunity across the community and strengthens our region. When we create hiring practices and policies that give people a second chance at stable employment, we all win.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂA critical aspect of criminal justice reform is ensuring that people with past convictions have viable employment options, and pathways to economic mobility after incarceration. We are excited to join JPMorgan Chase and other partners to promote scalable inclusive hiring practices in Central Ohio,ÃÂÃÂ said Christopher Walter, Chief External Affairs Officer, Center for Employment Opportunities. ÃÂÃÂJPMorgan Chase is proving that modernizing hiring practices benefits employers by providing them with access to this highly motivated, hard working and loyal workforce.ÃÂÃÂ In addition, through the Second Chance Business Coalition, JPMorgan Chase will engage with other local employers committed to adopting and promoting Second Chance hiring policies by sharing best practices, insights and learnings. JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs hiring efforts in Columbus build on a range of actions the firm has taken to expand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to pursue careers within the firm, such as proactively ÃÂÃÂbanning the boxÃÂÃÂ on job applications and removing all questions about criminal backgrounds from job applications. As a result of these efforts, in 2020, over 2,100 people with criminal backgrounds were hired ÃÂÃÂ approximately 10 percent of JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs new hires in the U.S. Many were involved in low-level crimes such as disorderly conduct, personal drug possession and DUI (driving under the influence), and are employed in jobs such as transaction processing, and lending and account servicing. Approximately 70 million Americans have a criminal record. Research shows that individuals with a conviction history often experience significant collateral consequences as a result, including barriers to employment and a lack of opportunities to advance professionally. For example, a criminal record alone can reduce the chances of a second interview by 50 percent. A Society for Human Resource Management study found that 82 percent of managers feel that the ÃÂÃÂquality of hireÃÂÃÂ for workers with criminal records is as high as or higher than that for workers without records. Policymakers and businesses increasingly recognize that providing education, skills training and employment opportunities to people with arrest or conviction histories helps reduce recidivism, increase public safety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. In addition to the firmÃÂÃÂs hiring efforts in Columbus, the firm is taking several other actions to remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds: a. Public Policy Agenda: Through the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter, the firm has been developing and advancing sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions to help remove barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds. People with criminal records face economic barriers including hiring discrimination and lost job opportunities, as well as access to higher education or capital to start a business. The drag on the earning potential of tens of millions of Americans are costs not only borne by individuals, their families, and their communities, but also have large economic consequences that contribute to inequality. This disproportionately affects people of color, with Black adults being over five times more likely to be incarcerated than white adults. Examples of the firmÃÂÃÂs work to create greater opportunity for people with records include: Reforming Industry Hiring Rules by working with the FDIC to modify Sec 19 rules for people with convictions for certain low-risk crimes to qualify for jobs in the banking industry without increasing risk to safety and soundness. Endorsing the Fair Chance Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2019 and helps qualified workers with arrest or conviction records compete for employment in federal agencies and with federal contractors. Supporting the restoration of access to Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals. Signed into federal law in 2020, this allows incarcerated individuals to pursue post-secondary education in prison, increasing employment opportunities after their release. Advancing bipartisan Clean Slate Automatic Record Clearing, including support for federal House and Senate measures, as well as state legislation to streamline the record clearing process for eligible offenses and help individuals move on from their records. In Michigan, for example, JPMorgan Chase supported a landmark bipartisan Clean Slate measure in 2020 that will automatically clear eligible records for roughly one million people across the state. Supporting the federal Driving for Opportunity Act and state measures which seek to limit driverÃÂÃÂs license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees unrelated to driving infractions. b. Philanthropic Commitments: JPMorgan Chase is investing an additional $12.5 million to help community organizations in cities like Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Nashville and Delaware, connect people with criminal backgrounds with in-demand, well-paying jobs, the tools and resources they need to achieve their financial goals, and entrepreneurship training. The firmÃÂÃÂs philanthropic commitments also include collaborations with organizations like the Financial Health Network, Cabrini Green Legal Aid, Safer Foundation, and the Center for Employment Opportunity to help provide people with arrest or conviction records with access to the resources that they need to advance their financial health, access legal advice and build in-demand skills for stable career pathways.

Optimism is slightly higher among Black (54%) and Latinx (49%) respondents as many have taken action to improve their credit, spending, or earn a second income. The new Chase Financial Health Consumer StudyÃÂÃÂconducted in partnership with Morning ConsultÃÂÃÂsurveyed more than 5,000 U.S. consumers on the state of their finances, attitudes towards saving and budgeting, and actions theyÃÂÃÂve taken to improve their financial health. The survey polled consumers across all demographics and took a closer look at the financial goals and impacts among Black and Latinx consumers ÃÂÃÂ populations hardest hit by the economic impact of the pandemic. ÃÂÃÂThese findings underscore the challenges from loss of jobs and income and the impact the pandemic has had on consumer finances, but also puts into focus how Americans are thinking about money in the future,ÃÂÃÂ said Lawrence Bailey, Head of Community & Business Development at Chase. ÃÂÃÂSmall steps matter. From saving a little more each month to monitoring your credit score ÃÂÃÂ these steps help consumers prepare for the unexpected, while also setting them up for success in the long run.ÃÂÃÂ Unsurprisingly, the pandemic has had a significant impact on consumersÃÂÃÂ finances, as many experienced a loss of income or a financial fluctuation over the last year. 37% of the general population said that their financial situation has gotten worse over the last year, with 16% reporting a job loss, furlough or loss of income over the last 12 months. 20% said that they had less disposable income, which is consistent among Black (23%) and Latinx (25%) respondents. Still, consumers feel more optimistic about their financial future and are taking actionable steps to improve their financial health. 65% of the general population believe they are currently in good financial health. Black (54%) and Latinx (49%) respondents are more optimistic about their finances this year, slightly higher than the general population at 48%. 51% of the general population are focusing on improving their savings, 39% on eliminating debt. 24% of Black and Latinx respondents said that theyÃÂÃÂve taken action to improve their credit, compared to 19% of the general population. Black (21%) and Latinx (19%) respondents started a new business or side hustle in the last year, compared to 11% of the general population. More than half of consumers used or plan to use their stimulus checks to pay essential bills 53% of the general population used funds to pay bills, like utilities, credit card or their phone 36% put money toward savings 30% paid down debt 22% paid rent or mortgage 10% put money toward a ÃÂÃÂnice to haveÃÂÃÂ, like entertainment 7% donated to a cause Paying bills on time, budgeting are top financial goals this year Survey respondents all agreed that their top financial goals in the past year included paying bills, like utilities, as well as their mortgage in full and consistently each month. Additionally: 32% of the general population indicate developing or maintaining a budget that works for them as a primary goal. Black (20%) and Latinx (22%) respondents listed getting their finances in order to purchase a home as a financial goal, compared with 14% of the general population. Black (16%) and Latinx (14%) respondents plan to start a business this year, compared to 9% of the general population. The majority of consumers think itÃÂÃÂs important to save, but fewer are confident in their ability to do so While 83% of the general population agree itÃÂÃÂs important to budget for long-term finances and emergency savings each month, fewer (76%) are confident in their ability to do so, and 62% felt confident in their ability to set aside money for retirement. Income is the biggest driver in the availability of emergency funds. Black (34%) and Latinx (36%) respondents indicate they donÃÂÃÂt have enough money to support them if they become unable to work. While many Baby Boomers are at or near retirement age, fewer than half (48%) have enough financial resources to support them if suddenly unable to work for more than four months. Consumers equally value in-person advice, digital tools when looking to improve financial health 34% of the general population prefer a digital tool that helps them budget or automatically save, consistent with a third who prefer expert advice or interaction with a banker.

Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt auf dem Weg des Unternehmens hin zu Omnichannel-Zahlungen in Europa. Er ergÃÂÃÂ¤nzt die bestehende Produktpalette, die J.P. Morgan den HÃÂÃÂ¤ndlern in der Region anbietet. ÃÂÃÂViele unserer Einzelhandelskunden in den HaupteinkaufsstraÃÂÃÂen Europas bereiten sich nach den Herausforderungen der globalen Pandemie auf die WiedererÃÂÃÂ¶ffnung nach dem Lockdown vor. Wir werden in der Lage sein, sie bei diesen BemÃÂÃÂ¼hungen zu unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzenÃÂÃÂ, so Basil Bailey, Head of Product for EMEA Merchant Services. ÃÂÃÂDer E-Commerce hat im vergangenen Jahr deutlich zugelegt. Wir sehen aber auch, dass die Verbraucher gerne wieder in echten LÃÂÃÂ¤den einkaufen mÃÂÃÂ¶chten. Wir bieten den HÃÂÃÂ¤ndlern in dieser Umstellungsphase neben unserer etablierten E-Commerce-Abwicklungsplattform eine ZahlungsmÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeit im GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ft an und versetzen sie so in die Lage, ihre BetriebsablÃÂÃÂ¤ufe optimieren, Zeit und Kosten einzusparen und sich letztlich auf ihr Wachstum zu konzentrierenÃÂÃÂ, so Bailey weiter. Die neue KartenzahlungslÃÂÃÂ¶sung zeigt das Engagement des Unternehmens fÃÂÃÂ¼r Wachstum und Expansion auf internationaler Ebene. Partner wie ACI Worldwide, Aurus und FreedomPay werden das Unternehmen bei der Bereitstellung dieses verbesserten Angebots unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzen, das den EinzelhÃÂÃÂ¤ndlern dabei hilft, sich an ein neues Umfeld anzupassen.

Morgan Survey Finds","FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Undeterred by supply chain challenges thrown up by COVID-19, German businesses are doubling down on globalization, embracing technology as a means to adapt, and planning for ownership transitions in the medium term, according to J.P. MorganÃÂÃÂs inaugural Germany Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. J.P. Morgan surveyed 238 senior executives of German mid-cap companies and found that nearly 60% believe the global and German economies are heading in a positive direction over the next year. This optimism is being fueled by three-quarters of respondents reporting that they anticipate revenue/sales and profits will increase in the year ahead. While many executive leaders are optimistic about the future, theyÃÂÃÂre faced with the realities of an unpredictable operating environment. According to the survey, top challenges include: COVID-19: Many of the challenges executive leaders face are still directly related to COVID-19, as 37% of businesses report shifting consumer habits due to COVID-19 as their top challenge. Supply Chain: After the desire for new customers, another challenge executives cite around their international activity is gaining access to suppliers and materials. As contributing factors, 62% of executives say the pandemic has increased supply chain issues, and 28% say Brexit has made supply chains worse as well. Internet Reliability: More than a quarter (26%) of executives surveyed cited a need for technology upgrades to stay relevant as one of their top three business challenges. A lack of high-speed internet is a longstanding issue that has only become more apparent over the past yearÃÂÃÂnearly half (46%) of executives would like the German government to focus on improving access over the next year. ÃÂÃÂBusinesses operate in a world in constant change, but this past year required them to pivot and invest in their operating models in new and challenging waysÃÂÃÂfrom technology adoption for remote employees to managing their supply chains,ÃÂÃÂ said Bernhard Brinker, Head of Commercial Banking, J.P. Morgan Germany. ÃÂÃÂHowever, companies are optimistic that the changes theyÃÂÃÂve made over the past year will help them be increasingly efficient within the year and poised for growth domestically and internationally.ÃÂÃÂ In addition to planning for operating challenges, German businesses responded to 2020ÃÂÃÂs economic realities by shifting their operating models and adapting their business strategies to maintain some level of success in the new environment. As they begin to look toward a post-pandemic world, German executives are now looking to progress their businesses in new ways, including: Continued Global Expansion: In today's globalized economy, 85% of German companies say that 25% or more of their sales come from outside the European Union. Despite their already strong international footprint, two-thirds (65%) of German companies expect to further increase the number of countries theyÃÂÃÂll operate in over the next five years. Embracing Technology: 57% of respondents have already increased their use of online banking tools for electronic payments, have changed their operating model to be more online and have shifted employees to work from home. Of respondents who havenÃÂÃÂt yet made these changes, 24% plan to take these actions in the next six months. Preparing for Business Transitions: Responses from executives also indicate that a surge in mergers and acquisitions may be coming within the next five years, with nearly two-thirds (63%) saying theyÃÂÃÂre considering a full or partial ownership transfer. The most common path for German business leaders is to transition their business to a family member, with 25% saying they anticipate ownership transfers to family through inheritance, 21% reporting they expect to transfer ownership to family as a gift and another 21% anticipating a transfer of ownership to family through a sale. Nearly one-third (30%) of respondents plan to transition their businesses outside of their familyÃÂÃÂ15% to the companyÃÂÃÂs current management and another 15% to a third party. ÃÂÃÂMittelstand companies are the engine of the German economy. We look forward to continuing to serve this core section of our client base as many look to expand beyond their traditional border and fulfil their international ambitions, and as we expand our footprint in this important segment in the market,ÃÂÃÂ said Stefan Povaly, Head of J.P. Morgan Germany, Senior Country Officer. For more information on the 2021 J.P. Morgan Business Leaders Outlook in Germany, visit www.jpmorgan.com/businessleadersoutlook-germany. Survey Methodology J.P. MorganÃÂÃÂs Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from March 10-29, 2021. In total, 238 senior executives (CEOs, CFOs, heads of finance and owners) from German Mittelstand companies, with a majority of annual revenues ranging from $100 million to $2 billion participated in the survey. Results are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is +/-6.4% at a 95% confidence rate. About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

While vaccination rates and safety precautions remain a determining factor when planning travel, Canadians are ready to vacation within the next six months as a way to spend more time with family and friends after months of lockdown. Canadians are also planning to spend more on leisure travel, averaging CAD $3,356.00, with baby boomers (adults between ages 57-75) willing to splurge an average of CAD $4,225.00. Among domestic leisure travellers: 78 percent will prefer a quiet destination 7.3 days is the average duration 24 percent anticipate spending more on travel this year than a pre-pandemic year Road trips may begin to wane as cooler weather rolls around in the fall, and Canadians will likely be more open to domestic travel by plane, especially as more of the population is vaccinated. With November anticipated as the peak month for air travel, the number of Canadians interested in flying almost doubles to 55 percent, compared with 20 percent over the summer. While only 20 percent of Canadians are planning their domestic trips by plane this summer; the forecasted numbers more than double beginning September through to the end of 2021, with November being the peak month that Canadians (55 percent) are considering air travel. Canadians are most comfortable staying at a family member or friendÃÂÃÂs house; however, hotels make for 50 percent of lodging plans. 54% of travellers plan to be more diligent than usual in taking more time to research health and safety protocols when determining their lodging. Among the top health and safety expectations from travellers: 82 percent expect mandatory masks for hotel staff and employees 70 percent expect contactless check-in/services ÃÂÃÂDriven partly by changing consumer safety expectations, the manner in which travel payments are processed has also evolved over the past 18 months. Providing a contactless payments experience ÃÂÃÂ whether by cards, through online or in-app purchases ÃÂÃÂ is now table stakes for businesses whose customers have grown accustomed to this new easy and seamless payments experience,ÃÂÃÂ said Marilu Gaudio, President of Chase Merchant Services. ÃÂÃÂThe renewed level of interest in traveling more, combined with spending more, is validation that merchants must have their payments capabilities truly digital and contactless.ÃÂÃÂ Chase Merchant Services currently serves more than 112,000 Canadian businesses from coast to coast.

(NYSE:JPM) business focused on improving the quality, cost, and equity of employee healthcare, is investing in an innovative healthcare company that offers patients coordinated care and an enhanced primary care experience. Morgan Health announced today a $50 million investment in Vera Whole Health, its first investment in a coordinated care model. Vera is transforming how patients engage with healthcare, how providers deliver care, and how employers pay for care. Vera's model is centered on whole person healthcare led by a team of primary care physicians, nurses and health coaches supported by clinics and an integrated technology platform. VeraÃÂÃÂs high-touch, advanced primary care model delivers differentiated patient experience, quality outcomes, and cost efficiency for employer and payor partners. Employers under contract with Vera have seen an average patient Net Promoter Score of 90, and improved health outcomes and utilization. ÃÂÃÂOur goal with this first investment is to build a strong coordinated healthcare model ÃÂÃÂ with outstanding primary care and new ways to help employees navigate a healthcare system that is often very disconnected,ÃÂÃÂ said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Morgan Health, who will join the Vera Board of Directors upon the close of the transaction. ÃÂÃÂVera is proactively helping patients achieve ideal physical, mental and social health. And because they actively coordinate with other high-value health providers, theyÃÂÃÂre able to create a much better overall patient experience.ÃÂÃÂ Vera is at the forefront of employer-sponsored coordinated care. It recently completed a majority stake sale to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), an investment firm with a record of supporting the growth of value-based care business models. Vera currently operates a network of advanced primary care centers supported by an integrated technology platform in Arizona, Washington, California, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, Texas, Missouri, Kansas and Nevada and recently established a partnership with Central Ohio Primary Care, the largest independent physician-owned primary care group in the United States. In the employer-sponsored healthcare market, Vera is also working to move away from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement towards a globally capitated model. Its approach aims to better align financial incentives and reimburse primary care physicians for services (e.g. care coordination, referral management, etc.) that are highly valued by patients and improve outcomes. Medicare and Medicaid have successfully implemented globally capitated models, but these models have not yet been made widely available to patients covered by employer-sponsored health plans. Coordinated care can also address health equity, which will be a part of every aspect of Morgan HealthÃÂÃÂs investments and where the business will innovate. Peter Scher, Vice Chairman, JPMorgan Chase, who oversees Morgan Health, added, ÃÂÃÂOur investment in Vera underscores our commitment to measuring and incentivizing providers to address health disparities. Health disparities not only impact different communities, but also limit gains in quality of care and health for the broader population.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂWe are in complete alignment with Morgan Health in addressing health disparities,ÃÂÃÂ said Ryan Schmid, Vera CEO and Co-Founder. ÃÂÃÂYears ago we built an advanced primary care model that addresses peopleÃÂÃÂs whole health ÃÂÃÂ physical, social and mental. This unique partnership will not only give us the opportunity to transform the way healthcare is delivered and paid for, but also address the role that social determinants of health, including racial bias, plays in our system.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂMorgan Health and Vera represent next generation healthcare models aimed at employers and employees,ÃÂÃÂ said Ravi Sachdev, CD&R Partner and Vera Board Director. ÃÂÃÂWe believe these types of new and innovative value-based care platforms will enhance delivery quality and outcomes and strengthen physician alignment.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂWe are very excited by the opportunities the Vera and Morgan Health partnership creates to enable employers to move beyond simply providing health insurance,ÃÂÃÂ noted Dr. Bill Wulf, Chief Executive Officer of Central Ohio Primary Care. ÃÂÃÂWorking with Vera, businesses can take the next step bringing high-quality, coordinated care to employees through active collaboration with all primary care providers and healthcare systems, not only in Ohio, but across the country.ÃÂÃÂ This is Morgan HealthÃÂÃÂs first step to begin scaling a coordinated care model. There is tremendous innovation in many coordinated care models and Morgan Health will look at a number of models to improve employee health and scale those models both for JP Morgan Chase and other employers and employees throughout the country. About Morgan Health Morgan Health is a JPMorgan Chase business unit focused on improving the quality, cost, and equity of employee healthcare. Morgan Health is focused on JPMorgan Chase employees and families, and also building scaleable models for other employers that drive innovation in broader healthcare markets.

Morgan erwirbt Mehrheitsbeteiligung an der Bezahldienst-Sparte Volkswagen Payments,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--J.P. Morgan meldet heute den Abschluss einer strategischen Vereinbarung mit Volkswagen Financial Services, die den Erwerb einer Mehrheitsbeteiligung von nahezu 75 % an der von Volkswagen Payments S.A. betriebenen Zahlungsplattform des Automobilherstellers vorsieht, vorbehaltlich der aufsichtsrechtlichen Genehmigungen. Die Transaktion wird die digitalen ZahlungsmÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten der Bank erweitern und die Plattform erstmals fÃÂÃÂ¼r die breitere Automobilbranche zugÃÂÃÂ¤nglich machen. Im Laufe der Zeit wird die Allianz zwischen den beiden Unternehmen versuchen, die Plattform auch fÃÂÃÂ¼r neue MÃÂÃÂ¤rkte und Branchen auÃÂÃÂerhalb des Automobilsektors zu entwickeln, wo mobilitÃÂÃÂ¤tsbezogene Zahlungen eine zentrale Rolle spielen werden. Volkswagen Financial Services wird weiterhin Anteilseigner bleiben, und die Plattform wird auch in Zukunft den Zahlungsverkehr im gesamten Volkswagen-Netzwerk zur UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung aller Marken des Volkswagen-Konzerns weltweit ermÃÂÃÂ¶glichen. Volkswagen Payments S.A. wurde 2017 in Luxemburg gegrÃÂÃÂ¼ndet und betreibt eine fÃÂÃÂ¼hrende Zahlungsplattform fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Automobilindustrie. Das Unternehmen ist auf 32 MÃÂÃÂ¤rkten weltweit tÃÂÃÂ¤tig und bietet eine Reihe von digitalen Zahlungsdiensten fÃÂÃÂ¼r das gesamte Auto-ÃÂÃÂkosystem an. Dazu gehÃÂÃÂ¶ren die Bereiche Ersterwerb und Leasing, Zahlungen im Fahrzeug, Tanken, Aufladen von Elektrofahrzeugen, Parken und Abonnementdienste wie z.B. Versicherungen sowie Bordunterhaltung. Es konzentriert sich auf die digitale Vernetzung des Auto-ÃÂÃÂkosystems und die Verbesserung der Zahlungsabwicklung fÃÂÃÂ¼r Verbraucher, HÃÂÃÂ¤ndler und Lieferanten gleichermaÃÂÃÂen. Die Plattform ist eine natÃÂÃÂ¼rliche ErgÃÂÃÂ¤nzung des GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftsbereichs Wholesale Payments von J.P. Morgan, der Treasury Services fÃÂÃÂ¼r Unternehmen, Handelsfinanzierungen sowie Karten- und HÃÂÃÂ¤ndlerservices vereint und Endkunden in allen Wirtschaftsbereichen eine integrierte Zahlungsabwicklung bietet. Volkswagen Payments S.A. wird weiterhin in Luxemburg ansÃÂÃÂ¤ssig sein. Das GroÃÂÃÂherzogtum ist zugleich einer der wichtigsten Standorte von J.P. Morgan in Europa, wo das Unternehmen seit mehr als 45 Jahren Kunden betreut. Die Vereinbarung kommt zu einer Zeit, in der Kunden unabhÃÂÃÂ¤ngig von der Branche oder dem Sektor durchgÃÂÃÂ¤ngige LÃÂÃÂ¶sungen fÃÂÃÂ¼r digitale Zahlungen erwarten. Die Automobilindustrie konzentriert sich immer stÃÂÃÂ¤rker auf diesen Bereich, in dem sich somit weltweit betrÃÂÃÂ¤chtliche Wachstumschancen bieten. Allein fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Zahlungen im Auto wird fÃÂÃÂ¼r das Jahr 2021 ein Volumen von 4 Mrd. US-Dollar prognostiziert1. J.P. Morgan geht davon aus, dass das vernetzte Fahrzeug, das digitale Bezahlerlebnis und individuell angepasste Bezahldienste in Zukunft zentrale Bestandteile von GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftsmodellen sein werden. Shahrokh Moinian, EMEA Head of Wholesale Payments bei J.P. Morgan, sagte: ÃÂÃÂWir planen, auf der innovativen Grundlage der bestehenden Plattform von Volkswagen Financial Services aufzubauen und die globale Reichweite unserer Expertise im Zahlungsverkehr dafÃÂÃÂ¼r zu nutzen, die sich entwickelnden Kundenerwartungen in der Automobilbranche und darÃÂÃÂ¼ber hinaus zu erfÃÂÃÂ¼llen.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂAllgemein weisen Zahlungen im Auto viele der Merkmale der GeldbÃÂÃÂ¶rse der Zukunft aufÃÂÃÂ, ergÃÂÃÂ¤nzte Max Neukirchen, Global Head of Merchant Services bei J.P.

Morgan der ideale Partner fÃÂÃÂ¼r Volkswagen Payments S.A., um dem Bedarf der Marken des Volkswagen-Konzerns an maÃÂÃÂgeschneiderten Automobil-ZahlungslÃÂÃÂ¶sungen weltweit gerecht zu werden.ÃÂÃÂ Dr. Mario Daberkow, CIO der Volkswagen Financial Services AG, fÃÂÃÂ¼gte hinzu: ÃÂÃÂWir sind stolz auf den erfolgreichen Aufbau und Betrieb von Volkswagen Payments S.A. und werden als starker Anteilseigner sicherstellen, dass dieses Unternehmen den Volkswagen-Konzern und seine Marken weiterhin mit maÃÂÃÂgeschneiderten und innovativen LÃÂÃÂ¶sungen und Dienstleistungen im digitalen Zahlungsverkehr unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzt.ÃÂÃÂ Es wird erwartet, dass die Transaktion im ersten Halbjahr 2022 abgeschlossen wird.

Chase ist die grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂÃÂte Privatkundenbank in den USA und stellt mehr als 60 Millionen amerikanischen Haushalten ein vielfÃÂÃÂ¤ltiges Spektrum an Finanzdienstleistungen bereit. Neukunden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen sich unter chase.co.uk registrieren und werden anschlieÃÂÃÂend eingeladen, die Chase-App herunterzuladen. ÃÂÃÂber die einfache und intuitive App kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen Kunden in wenigen Minuten ein Girokonto erÃÂÃÂ¶ffnen. Das Konto verfÃÂÃÂ¼gt ÃÂÃÂ¼ber eine Reihe von Funktionen, die Menschen helfen, ihr Geld zu verwalten, auszugeben und zu sparen. Ein britisch gefÃÂÃÂ¼hrtes Supportteam wird eine wichtige Komponente des Banking-Erlebnisses bei Chase sein. Durch wenige Fingertipps in der Chase-App werden die Kunden mit einem Experten verbunden ÃÂÃÂ 24 Stunden tÃÂÃÂ¤glich und an 7 Wochentagen. Sanoke Viswanathan, CEO bei der Bank, kommentiert: ÃÂÃÂWir bieten den Menschen in GroÃÂÃÂbritannien die Gelegenheit, Chase erstmals als Inhaber oder Inhaberin eines Girokontos zu erleben, das auf Klarheit, einem unkomplizierten PrÃÂÃÂ¤mienprogramm und einem ÃÂÃÂ¼berragenden Kundensupport basiert.ÃÂÃÂ Das Chase-Girokonto kommt zusammen mit einem PrÃÂÃÂ¤mienprogramm auf den Markt, das 12 Monate lang 1 % Cashback auf alle qualifizierten Debitkartenausgaben auszahlt*. Das PrÃÂÃÂ¤mienprogramm wurde speziell auf das Ausgabenverhalten von britischen Verbrauchern zugeschnitten, damit alle Kunden von PrÃÂÃÂ¤mien fÃÂÃÂ¼r eine Vielzahl alltÃÂÃÂ¤glicher Ausgaben profitieren kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen, wie Lebensmittel, Reisen, Restaurant, Unterhaltung, Mode, Haushaltswaren, Elektronik sowie FlÃÂÃÂ¼ge und Urlaub. FÃÂÃÂ¼r die ErÃÂÃÂ¶ffnung des Chase-Girokontos und das Sammeln von Cashback-PrÃÂÃÂ¤mien werden keine GebÃÂÃÂ¼hren erhoben. Die Kunden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen von Cashback-PrÃÂÃÂ¤mien profitieren, ohne dass sie ihre Hausbank wechseln, einen Mindestkontostand einhalten oder Lastschriftverfahren einrichten mÃÂÃÂ¼ssen. Das Cashback von 1 % fÃÂÃÂ¤llt bei jeder PrÃÂÃÂ¤senz- oder Onlinezahlung mit der Chase-Debitkarte an HÃÂÃÂ¤ndler im In- und Ausland an. Neben dem einfachen und unkomplizierten PrÃÂÃÂ¤mienprogramm bietet Chase zahlreiche weitere Vorteile: Anpassbare weitere Girokonten fÃÂÃÂ¼r eine einfache Budgetplanung, die in wenigen Sekunden ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die Chase-App konfiguriert werden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen und den Kunden dabei helfen, ihren BedÃÂÃÂ¼rfnissen entsprechend das Budget zu planen, Geld zurÃÂÃÂ¼ckzulegen, zu sparen oder auszugeben. Jedes Chase-Konto hat eine eigene Kontonummer und kann mit der Chase-Debitkarte verbunden werden, sodass die Ausgaben vom ausgewÃÂÃÂ¤hlten Konto abgebucht werden. Aufrundung von Wechselgeld, auf das 12 Monate lang 5 % Zinsen gezahlt werden. Kunden kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen gleichzeitig Geld ausgeben und sparen, indem sie ihre EinkÃÂÃÂ¤ufe mit der Debitkarte auf das nÃÂÃÂ¤chsthÃÂÃÂ¶here volle britische Pfund aufrunden und das Wechselgeld auf ein separates Konto ÃÂÃÂ¼berweisen, wo es 12 Monate lang zu 5 %** verzinst wird. Die Aufrundungen werden in den nÃÂÃÂ¤chsten Wochen fÃÂÃÂ¼r alle Kunden angeboten. GebÃÂÃÂ¼hrenfreie Nutzung der Debitkarte im Ausland. Chase berechnet seinen Kunden keine GebÃÂÃÂ¼hren fÃÂÃÂ¼r Kartennutzungen auf Reisen, auch nicht fÃÂÃÂ¼r Bargeldabhebungen an Geldautomaten im Ausland. Nummernlose Debitkarte.

The following is the Executive Summary. The full fact sheet is available online here. Executive Summary In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced the $30 Billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The firm is bringing together its business, philanthropy, policy and data expertise to advance racial equity and drive inclusive growth. The five-year Commitment includes lending, equity and direct funding to help increase sustainable homeownership, expand affordable housing, grow small businesses, support diverse suppliers, improve financial health and access to banking and build a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The firm is building the infrastructure and foundation to make progress on its Racial Equity Commitment. With more work to do, below is a summary of progress. Moving forward, JPMorgan Chase plans to publish its progress annually in its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report starting in May 2022. Summary of Progress JPMorgan Chase has deployed or committed more than $13 billion of its $30 billion goal to help close the racial wealth gap. This is largely driven by homeownership refinance and affordable rental housing preservation, which were existing products and processes where the firm took prompt action to do more. While there is more work to do, below is an update on the Commitment. Mortgage Refinance: Given the historically low rate environment, the firm quickly helped homeowners save money on their monthly mortgage payments by refinancing 16,000 of the 20,000 incremental loans goal, $4 billion to date.1 Homeownership: Hired more than 130 Community Home Lending Advisors, expanded the homebuyer grant program to $5,000 in 6,700 minority neighborhoods nationwide and enhanced mortgage products to create better access to credit through pricing improvements and credit expansion. Affordable Rental Housing: Funded more than $6 billion in loans to help preserve more than 60,000 affordable housing and rental housing units across the U.S. Also approved lending of $1 billion for the new construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. Grow Small Business: Hired more than 20 diverse senior business consultants to provide free one-on-one coaching for business owners in 13 U.S. cities and have mentored more than 900 small business owners so far. Financial Health: Helped customers open more than 200,000 low cost checking accounts with no overdraft fees. Opened nine Community Center branches and hired 72 Community Managers in underserved communities to build and nurture relationships with community leaders, nonprofit partners and small businesses. Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs): Invested more than $100 million of equity in 14 diverse-owned or -led MDIs and CDFIs that serve more than 87 communities in 18 states and the District of Columbia. Workforce: Grew partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 3 to 17 to deepen the firmÃÂÃÂs recruiting partnerships, expand curriculum development, scholarships and mentorship programs. The firm pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024. It has hired more than 3,800 Black students as interns, fellows and entry-level analysts and is on track to surpass the original goal. Philanthropy: Committed $128 million of its five-year, $2 billion philanthropic target, which includes grants, low cost loans and direct equity. The firm is on pace to allocate its full year target of more than $400 million by the end of the year. Additional Activities: The Racial Equity Commitment has been a catalyst for evolving how the firm does business and has inspired other activities and investments that go above and beyond the $30 billion. Some examples include creating an Empower money market share class, co-investing $200 million in Project Black, elevating DEI standards as part of its supply chain assessment and investing in the Appraiser Diversity Initiative. Visit jpmorganchase.com to learn more. Reporting and Governance: Established a robust reporting and governance process for consistent tracking of the $30 billion Commitment, which is run by the Community Impact organization. The Public Responsibility Committee (PRC) of the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors provides oversight of this work and is briefed bimonthly on the firmÃÂÃÂs progress. Next Steps Building on the hiring of community managers, community home lending advisors and small business consultants, the creation and enhancement of products, expansion of new branches in more communities and other efforts, the firm plans to take the following next steps. Homeownership: Continue prudently expanding FHA lending and supporting policy reforms to the FHA program, including servicing standards. Affordable Rental Housing: Explore innovative financing solutions and work with new public resources to support the development of vital community facilities and new housing for individuals and families earning a wider range of incomes than conventional projects serve. Small Business: Further expand access to credit through targeted adjustments to how the firm evaluates credit applications, and it will introduce new product offerings. Financial Health: Continue to open more branches, including Community Center branches in low-to-moderate income communities, hire additional Community Managers and host more financial health workshops. Workforce: Continue to build a more equitable and representative workforce and hold executives accountable. Community Engagement: Host more local convenings with executives who play a direct role in the development of products, services, policy solutions and community investments. Multicultural Engagement: Explore opportunities to expand access to in-language resources, services and support in accordance with the latest guidelines from industry regulators.

Morgan arbeiten partnerschaftlich an Investitionen in unterschiedliche ExistenzgrÃÂÃÂ¼nder,"BOULDER, Colorado (USA)--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Techstars gab heute ein neues, von J.P. Morgan organisiertes Beschleunigungsprogramm bekannt, mit dem landesweit mehr als 80 Millionen US-Dollar in verschiedene Unternehmer und GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder investiert werden. Techstars und J.P. Morgan begannen im Jahr 2021 partnerschaftlich bei der Entwicklung dieses Programms zusammenzuarbeiten, das den Schwerpunkt darauf legt, in bedeutenden Wirtschaftszentren den gleichwertigen Zugang zu FinanzierungsmÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten zu fÃÂÃÂ¶rdern. Im ersten Halbjahr 2021 erhielten Unternehmer mit schwarzer Hautfarbe nur 1,2 Prozent der amerikanischen Risikokapitalfinanzierung. ZusÃÂÃÂ¤tzliche Daten weisen darauf hin, dass lateinamerikanische GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder 2021 nur 2 Prozent der US-amerikanischen Risikokapitalinvestitionen aufbrachten. Diese Partnerschaft ist darauf ausgerichtet, ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die einzigartigen Startup-Beschleuniger von Techstars BrÃÂÃÂ¼cken ÃÂÃÂ¼ber die VermÃÂÃÂ¶genskluft durch ethnische Unterschiede zu schlagen. Die FÃÂÃÂ¶rderung bietet Zugriff auf Kapital, Eins-zu-Eins-Betreuung und eine individuell angepasste Programmierung fÃÂÃÂ¼r Unternehmer im FrÃÂÃÂ¼hstadium. ÃÂÃÂDie Daten und Erfahrungen zeigen, dass GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder aus verschiedenen Gemeinschaften und mit diversen HintergrÃÂÃÂ¼nden einen unerschlossenen Markt mit hervorragenden finanziellen Vorteilen fÃÂÃÂ¼r Investoren, die Unternehmen und die Gemeinschaften, in denen sie tÃÂÃÂ¤tig sind, reprÃÂÃÂ¤sentieren. Unser Ziel mit J.P. Morgan besteht darin, die Art wie unsere Programme dunkelhÃÂÃÂ¤utige, lateinamerikanische und sonstige unterreprÃÂÃÂ¤sentierte GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder anziehen, unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzen und in sie investieren, durchschlagender zu gestaltenÃÂÃÂ, sagte MÃÂÃÂ¤elle Gavet, CEO von Techstars. ÃÂÃÂGemeinsam mit Techstars lautet unser Ziel, den Zugriff auf das Kapital und sonstige Ressourcen zu verbessern, die unterreprÃÂÃÂ¤sentierte Unternehmer benÃÂÃÂ¶tigen, um ihre GeschÃÂÃÂ¤fte zu starten, zu finanzieren und dann wachsen zu lassenÃÂÃÂ, sagte Kristin Kallergis Rowland, weltweite Leiterin alternativer Investitionen bei der J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Mit 27 % der Unternehmens-CEOs aus dem bestehenden Techstars Portfolio, die sich als Schwarzafrikaner, Spanier, Lateinamerikaner, amerikanische Ureinwohner, Indianer oder Ureinwohner Alaskas, Ureinwohner Hawaiis oder sonstige Pazifikinsulaner, Einwohner des Mittleren Ostens/Nordafrikas identifizieren, soll diese Partnerschaft diversen GrÃÂÃÂ¼ndern von wachstumsstarken Start-ups im FrÃÂÃÂ¼hstadium weitere UnterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzung bieten, damit sie ein grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂÃÂeres Einkommen, stÃÂÃÂ¤rkeren Einfluss und Wohlstand aufbauen kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen. ÃÂÃÂDas ÃÂÃÂ¼ber viele Jahre angelegte Programm wird sich auf Unternehmer und GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder konzentrieren, die von herkÃÂÃÂ¶mmlichen Risikokapitalquellen ÃÂÃÂ¼bersehen wurdenÃÂÃÂ, sagte Tiffany Lewis, Leiterin der Strategie fÃÂÃÂ¼r Manager unterschiedlicher Herkunft bei J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ÃÂÃÂDiese neue Verpflichtung wird den Wechsel hin zu mehr gleichwertigen WirtschaftsmÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten mittels Zugriff auf Finanzdienstleistungen, Betreuung, QualitÃÂÃÂ¤tsausbildung und -schulung weiter entwickeln und inbegriffene GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftspraktiken fÃÂÃÂ¶rdern.ÃÂÃÂ In den nÃÂÃÂ¤chsten drei Jahren wird die Investition ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 37 Techstars Programme in neun US-StÃÂÃÂ¤dten auf mehr als 400 Unternehmen verteilt. Die ersten fÃÂÃÂ¼nf StÃÂÃÂ¤dte, Atlana, Chicago, Detroit, Miami und Washington D.C., starten heute mit einem Aufruf an Unternehmer jeglichen Hintergrunds, sich zu bewerben. Die Programme fÃÂÃÂ¼r Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York und Oakland werden 2023 beginnen. Alle neun dieser wachstumsstarken Technologie-ÃÂÃÂkosysteme wurden aus mehreren strategischen GrÃÂÃÂ¼nden ausgewÃÂÃÂ¤hlt, darunter die bestehenden unterschiedlichen Zusammensetzungen der BevÃÂÃÂ¶lkerungen, die jedes Programm widerzuspiegeln versucht. Jedes der dreimonatigen Programme wird GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder:innen wie Jasmine Jones unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzen, die 2020 den Techstars Kansas City Accelerator durchlief. Als MitgrÃÂÃÂ¼nderin des Techstars Portfoliounternehmens Cherry Blossom Intimates, beschreibt Jones ihre Techstars Erfahrung, die als TÃÂÃÂ¼rÃÂÃÂ¶ffner fÃÂÃÂ¼r MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten ohne Erfolgsgrenzen diente. ÃÂÃÂIch traf mehr als 90 Mentoren, die mich bei der Ausarbeitung meines GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftsmodells, der Erstellung meiner Kapitalisierungstabelle und der Einbringung von 1,25 Millionen US-Dollar 30 Tage lang unterstÃÂÃÂ¼tzten.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂWas ich fÃÂÃÂ¼r besonders interessant an der Teilnahme am Techstars Programm halte, ist, dass es die TÃÂÃÂ¼ren fÃÂÃÂ¼r neue MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten und GeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftspotenziale ÃÂÃÂ¶ffnetÃÂÃÂ, sagte Jones. ÃÂÃÂDas Netzwerk ist von unschÃÂÃÂ¤tzbarem Wert.ÃÂÃÂ Cherry Blossom Intimates ist eine akkreditierte medizinische Einrichtung, die online und konventionell arbeitet. WÃÂÃÂ¤hrend sie am Techstars Programm teilnahm, startete Jones auch Myya, die erste Marke fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Zeit nach einer Brustentnahme (Mastektomie), die auch mit der Krankenversicherung abgerechnet werden kann und die Verbindung von Patientinnen mit zertifizierten Anpasshilfen fÃÂÃÂ¼r BHs nach Mastektomie und mit Prothesenmustern von zuhause aus herstellt. Die Messung des Einflusses und eine gesicherte Haftung innerhalb dieses ÃÂÃÂ¼ber viele StÃÂÃÂ¤dte reichenden US-Programms ist allgegenwÃÂÃÂ¤rtig, da diese kleinen Schritte nach vorne dazu beitragen, die Kluft der ethnisch bedingten VermÃÂÃÂ¶gensverteilung und die zunehmende Ungleichheit ÃÂÃÂ¶konomischer Chancen zu schmÃÂÃÂ¤lern. Zwar sind die Programme fÃÂÃÂ¼r GrÃÂÃÂ¼nder mit beliebigem Hintergrund offen, doch konzentriert sich die Werbung dafÃÂÃÂ¼r auf Unternehmer afrikanischer, lateinamerikanischer und spanischer Abstammung und diejenigen, die sich als ethnisch divers identifizieren. Fortschritte werden regelmÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂÃÂig beobachtet und ÃÂÃÂ¼ber beide Organisationen hinweg den leitenden Positionen mitgeteilt. Diese MaÃÂÃÂnahmen werden zudem ermÃÂÃÂ¶glichen, dass das Programm seine maximale Wirkung entfalten kann. Sie sollen die Sicht der grÃÂÃÂ¶ÃÂÃÂeren Investmentgemeinschaft besser auf Chancengleichheit und Inklusion lenken. ÃÂÃÂber Techstars Das weltweite Netzwerk von Techstars verhilft Unternehmern zum Erfolg. Techstars wurde 2006 gegrÃÂÃÂ¼ndet und begann mit drei einfachen Ideen: Unternehmer schaffen eine bessere Zukunft fÃÂÃÂ¼r alle, Zusammenarbeit treibt Innovationen voran, und groÃÂÃÂartige Ideen kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen von ÃÂÃÂ¼berall herkommen.

To combat the tightening labor market, two-thirds of respondents plan to invest in their workforce through additional hiring, employee training and development, expanded benefits, and increased pay. Ahead of Small Business Week, ChaseÃÂÃÂs new Small Business Survey polled 1,000 small business owners to understand their financial and strategic business priorities, and how they view the state of their business following two challenging years of economic uncertainty. ÃÂÃÂSmall businesses are at the heart of every community. They create jobs and support their neighborhoods in good times and bad,ÃÂÃÂ said Ben Walter, CEO of Chase Business Banking. ÃÂÃÂWe are inspired by their resilience, ingenuity and service to others, and are here to offer the support, solutions and service they need to thrive.ÃÂÃÂ When evaluating small business ownersÃÂÃÂ reflections on the state of their business, the survey evaluated four key areas: Workforce, Financial, Purpose & Vision and Operations. Workforce: Approximately two-thirds of small business owners say they are likely to invest in training and development for their workforce (66%), increase employee pay (66%), hire additional staff in the next year (65%) and expand benefits to their workforce (64%). Financial: More than half of small business owners (55%), new and established, feel they have adequate access to new funding or credit should they need it. Purpose & Vision: Fewer than half of small business owners (48%) strongly feel they have a business mentor that they go to for advice, though 71% are interested in entrepreneurial training and/or mentorship to help run their business. Operations: More than half of small business owners (60%) feel strongly that they have the right technology in place, with three in four (73%) likely to adopt new technology in the year ahead. In terms of future-proofing their businesses, 48% say they have an explicit contingency plan in place as a result of COVID-19 to help them manage unexpected disruptions. The survey also asked respondents about the most important products, tools and resources they sought from a financial partner in order to grow and sustain their business. Key business qualities include: Convenience: 83% of small business owners say being easy to work with is an important attribute in a financial services partner closely followed by easy to use online platforms (82%) and easy to contact live support (81%). When it comes to business checking accounts, 82% of small business owners say an easy-to-use online/mobile banking interface is important. Advice: 65% of small business owners say they are likely to work with a financial or business advisor in the next year, while 40% say they seek advice from other small business owners. Business Credit Cards & Rewards: 53% of small business owners with a business credit card say it allows them to more closely monitor business expenses, and close to half look for good cash-back rewards. Payment Solutions: 83% of small business owners say reliability is an important attribute of a payment processing solutions, as well as security of both customer data and company data (82%), and ease of use for customers and themselves/their employees (84%). Customer Analytics & Intelligence: 69% of small business owners say it's important for a financial services partner to offer customer insights and business intelligence services. ÃÂÃÂSmall business owners have been forced to grapple with challenges over the last two years that no one anticipated,ÃÂÃÂ said Jenny Shum, General Manager of Chase Ink. ÃÂÃÂThrough our Chase Ink suite of business credit cards, weÃÂÃÂre constantly listening to our customers to deliver the tools and rewards they need to continue growing and investing in their business to build a more resilient and agile future.ÃÂÃÂ During the month of May, to celebrate Small Business Week and beyond, Chase for Business plans to introduce new tools, offers, and events for small business owners across its suite of products including Chase Business Checking, Chase Ink credit cards and Chase Payments Solutions. Updates include: Educational events: Beginning in May, Chase will bring back its Business Insights Series with expert speakers in 30 U.S. markets to help entrepreneurs outthink the competition, embrace uncertainty, improve customer loyalty and win sales.

Morgan Survey Finds","FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nearly all (95%) German Mittelstand leaders expect business repercussions from the war in Ukraine for at least six months, up 14% from March, citing higher energy prices (50%), commodity prices (47%) and inflation (38%) as the top impacts, according to J.P. MorganÃÂÃÂs second annual German Business Leaders Outlook survey released today. ÃÂÃÂUnsurprisingly, business leaders expect impacts from the war, but we believe Mittelstand companies are resilient and have the platform to grow their businesses as they overcome obstacles and navigate significant uncertainties,ÃÂÃÂ said Bernhard Brinker, Head of Commercial Banking, J.P. Morgan DACH Region. J.P. Morgan found that the Mittelstand community has notable concerns to navigate in the year ahead after surveying more than 240 senior executives of German Mittelstand companies in both March and May in response to changing geopolitical and macro-economic events. In fact, nearly six in ten (58%) Mittelstand leaders cite higher and rising costs as the number one challenge theyÃÂÃÂre facing right now. And with rising energy prices cited as a top concern for the year ahead (25%) and a top impact from the war (50%), it comes to no surprise that when asked which areas the German government should focus on over the next 12 months, more than half (54%) rated reducing energy prices, followed by general infrastructure investments (39%). ÃÂÃÂWhile the business environment may be uncertain for the foreseeable future, we know and continue to see that the Mittelstand community is strong and will keep pushing their businesses forward,ÃÂÃÂ said Stefan Povaly, Head of J.P. Morgan Germany. Navigating Shifting Business Concerns, Seeking Growth Ongoing supply chain issues (14%) were cited as another challenge for Mittelstand leaders, and as a result, German companies are likely to increase their prices for goods and services (39%) according to the most recent data in the year ahead. Additional top business challenges for Mittelstand companies include higher costs of doing business (22%) and inflation (16%). In the face of these challenges, Mittelstand leaders continue to believe theyÃÂÃÂll be able to navigate the environment and are increasingly looking for opportunities to grow in the year ahead. In fact, eight in ten (83%) Mittelstand leaders anticipate growth in the year ahead, up 14% from March, especially when it comes to revenue/sales (78%) and profits (70%). Getting Creative to Tackle the Labour Shortage As Mittelstands continue to rebound following the pandemic however, many are struggling to find and retain quality workers as the labour shortage loomsÃÂÃÂcausing current employees to work more hours (41%) or requiring businesses to reduce or adjust their hours of operation (37%) . Because of the current skills gap, Mittelstand companies are taking longer to fill open positions (38%), investing more in training (38%), making strategic efforts to retain more experienced staff (36%) and hiring less qualified candidates (33%). Employers are also getting creative in response to the labour shortage in the hopes of attracting and retaining top talent by offering: Flexible working hours (48%) Increased benefits (45%) Upskilling or training opportunities (40%) Increased wages (34%) Proactive Succession Planning Mittelstand companies are preparing for company growth and the future of their business, with more than two-thirds of Mittelstand leaders planning a full (34%) or partial (35%) transfer of their businessesÃÂÃÂup 4% and 2% from last year respectively. And nearly half (46%) expect the transition to occur in the next two years. For leaders expecting to transition their business, more than half (56%) plan to keep the business in the family by transferring it through inheritance (23%), a sale (13%) or as a gift (20%).

In total, 242 (in March) and 244 (in May) Mittelstand leaders (CEOs, CFOs, heads of finance and owners) from German Mittelstand companies (annual revenues ranging from ÃÂÃÂ20 million to ÃÂÃÂ2 billion) across various industries participated in the survey. Results are within statistical parameters for validity, and the error rate is +/- 6.3% with a 95% confidence level. About JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Further, for employed individuals with low- and moderate-incomes, the high cost of care and insurance, including deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, forced many to forgo or delay necessary medical treatments. More than 150 million Americans depend on employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) for their health care. While the national focus on health inequities has centered on the U.S. population at large, the health status of ESI enrollees has not been well understood given historical data gaps and limitations in analyzing health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income. ÃÂÃÂThese findings are a wake-up call for business leaders on the severe health disparities that exist across the countryÃÂÃÂs workforce,ÃÂÃÂ said Dan Mendelson, Morgan Health CEO. ÃÂÃÂThe business community has a responsibility to understand and recognize these disparities, and more importantly, act to eliminate them. This will require active engagement with health plans and providers to close gaps and improve health outcomes.ÃÂÃÂ The Morgan Health-NORC analysis reflects the latest data on ESI enrollees from three nationally-representative, public surveys and national vital statistics records. The findings present an important snapshot of health outcomes and disparities prior to the onset of COVID-19. Some of the most significant disparities appear to be associated with income differences, while others vary by race and sexual orientation, even when controlling for other factors. Key Findings: The burden of chronic disease varies significantly across races with data revealing underdiagnosis of key conditions for certain patient populations. Blood pressure: 60.4 percent of Black enrollees, 40.7 percent of Asian enrollees and 44.2 percent of Hispanic enrollees had high blood pressure, compared to 46.0 percent of white enrollees. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 16.7 percentage points more likely to have high blood pressure than white enrollees. Furthermore, Black enrollees were 15.6 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Diabetes: Compared to white enrollees, Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees were more likely to have diabetes by 6.9 percentage points, 5.6 percentage points, and 5.3 percentage points, respectively, after adjusting for age and sex. The rate of undiagnosed diabetes was approximately 3 percentage points higher for Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees than white enrollees. Obesity: 42.8 percent of enrollees were classified as obese. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were more likely to be obese than white enrollees by 13.6 percentage points, while Asian enrollees were less likely to be obese than white employees by 26.2 percentage points. Blood pressure: 60.4 percent of Black enrollees, 40.7 percent of Asian enrollees and 44.2 percent of Hispanic enrollees had high blood pressure, compared to 46.0 percent of white enrollees. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 16.7 percentage points more likely to have high blood pressure than white enrollees. Furthermore, Black enrollees were 15.6 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have uncontrolled high blood pressure. Diabetes: Compared to white enrollees, Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees were more likely to have diabetes by 6.9 percentage points, 5.6 percentage points, and 5.3 percentage points, respectively, after adjusting for age and sex. The rate of undiagnosed diabetes was approximately 3 percentage points higher for Asian, Hispanic and Black enrollees than white enrollees. Obesity: 42.8 percent of enrollees were classified as obese. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were more likely to be obese than white enrollees by 13.6 percentage points, while Asian enrollees were less likely to be obese than white employees by 26.2 percentage points. Widespread variation in Cesarean section (C-section) delivery rates among races reinforce persistent maternal health gaps within the ESI market. Studies have shown that C-section delivery can significantly reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in high-risk deliveries. However, when performed in low-risk situations, C-sections can increase the risk of infections and blood clots and may contribute to unnecessary postpartum complications including death. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. The analysis showed that 20.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 17.0 percent of low-risk deliveries among Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees, respectively, were performed via C-section, compared to a rate of 13.6 percent among white enrollees. After adjusting for differences in age, Black, Asian and Hispanic enrollees with low-risk pregnancies were more likely to undergo a C-section than their white counterparts by 6.5, 3.9, and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. Behavioral health and substance use issues were prevalent among all enrollees, however, there were stark differences in severity of these issues and related outcomes for Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees. The overall rates of anxiety and depression within ESI were 13.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, white enrollees were more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian enrollees to experience serious psychological distress, by 2.0 percentage points, 1.8 percentage points, and 5.2 percentage points, respectively. The percent of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees who reported serious psychological distress was 12.1 percentage points higher, the rate of anxiety was 16.6 percentage points higher and the rate of depression was 18.4 percentage points higher than for straight enrollees after adjusting for age and sex. 19.8 percent of enrollees used tobacco products (inclusive of smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco), 30.1 percent reported heavy alcohol use, and 18.8 percent used illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, misuse of pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquilizers, to name a few. Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees. The overall rates of anxiety and depression within ESI were 13.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, white enrollees were more likely than Black, Hispanic and Asian enrollees to experience serious psychological distress, by 2.0 percentage points, 1.8 percentage points, and 5.2 percentage points, respectively. The percent of Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual enrollees who reported serious psychological distress was 12.1 percentage points higher, the rate of anxiety was 16.6 percentage points higher and the rate of depression was 18.4 percentage points higher than for straight enrollees after adjusting for age and sex. 19.8 percent of enrollees used tobacco products (inclusive of smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco), 30.1 percent reported heavy alcohol use, and 18.8 percent used illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, misuse of pain relievers, stimulants, and tranquilizers, to name a few. Heavy alcohol use was highest among Hispanic enrollees while illicit drug use was highest among white enrollees. Despite perceptions around the robustness of coverage within ESI, enrollees experience significant barriers to accessing care, particularly for those of racial/ethnic minority backgrounds and individuals with low or modest incomes. Specifically, 6.9 percent of enrollees reported missing medical care due to cost, 9.8 percent reported missing prescriptions due to cost, and 11.9 percent reported difficulty paying medical bills. These numbers vary widely by income. While nearly all enrollees (91.5 percent) reported having have a usual source of care, the analysis showed significant differences in emergency department (ED) utilization ÃÂÃÂ a proxy measure for care accessibility. After adjusting for age and sex, Black enrollees were 4.9 percentage points more likely than white enrollees to have visited an ED; in contrast, Asian enrollees were 4.5 percentage points less likely than white enrollees to have visited an ED. After adjusting for age and sex, enrollees in the lowest income bracket (under $50,000) were 7.1 percentage points more likely than enrollees in the highest income bracket ($150,000 or more) to have visited an ED. Specifically, 6.9 percent of enrollees reported missing medical care due to cost, 9.8 percent reported missing prescriptions due to cost, and 11.9 percent reported difficulty paying medical bills.

After adjusting for age and sex, enrollees in the lowest income bracket (under $50,000) were 7.1 percentage points more likely than enrollees in the highest income bracket ($150,000 or more) to have visited an ED. Even with employer-sponsored coverage, some enrollees have unmet social needs that can further exacerbate gaps in health outcomes. More than 7 percent of enrollees were food insecure. After controlling for age and sex, Black and Hispanic enrollees were more likely than white enrollees to be food insecure (by 9.8 and 6.0 percentage points, respectively). More than 7 percent of enrollees were food insecure. After controlling for age and sex, Black and Hispanic enrollees were more likely than white enrollees to be food insecure (by 9.8 and 6.0 percentage points, respectively).

Morgan Survey Finds","SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Australian midsized businesses are facing challenges rooted in the current labour market, supply chain disruptions and rising prices; yet, in the face of these obstacles, almost all expect growth (94%) and feel confident their businesses will thrive (80%) in the next 12 months, according to J.P. MorganÃÂÃÂs inaugural Australia Business Leaders Outlook Survey released today. ÃÂÃÂAustralian business leaders are finding ways to adapt to the evolving economic landscape,ÃÂÃÂ said Annabelle Mooney, Head of Commercial Banking for Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. ÃÂÃÂIn spite of headwinds, these midsize companies are primarily optimistic that growth is achievable and are well-positioned to navigate the challenges of todayÃÂÃÂs uncertain climate.ÃÂÃÂ In a survey of more than 200 senior executives from Australian midsize companies, there is optimism for the year ahead and confidence in their companiesÃÂÃÂ ability to growÃÂÃÂreflecting higher expectations than their counterparts in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, according to J.P. MorganÃÂÃÂs recent surveys. They also remain confident in the global and national economy (63%), despite ongoing challenges stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The challenges they cited most included a tie between labour concerns (27%) and rising prices (27%), followed by supply chain issues (18%). Their optimistic outlook could in-part stem from the new federal government taking office. In fact, more than half (56%) of Australian business leaders expect the recent election to have a positive impact on their business and just 6% foresee a negative impact, while others remain neutral. ÃÂÃÂDespite the business environment appearing uncertain for the foreseeable future, we know the Australian business community is resilient and nimble,ÃÂÃÂ said Robert Bedwell, Chief Executive Officer of Australia and New Zealand, J.P. Morgan. ÃÂÃÂWe continue to see these organisations overcome volatility and keep pushing forward with their expectation of growth on the horizon.ÃÂÃÂ Getting Creative to Tackle the Labour Shortage Even as optimism persists, most Australian business leaders (92%) cited feeling the effects of the current labour market as it continues to create obstacles for businesses across the country. As a result of the labour shortage, almost half of current employees (47%) are working more hours, and 44% of midsize businesses are seeing reduced sales/revenue. In the hopes of retaining and attracting top talent, Australian business leaders are implementing: Increased benefits (50%) Upskilling or training opportunities (48%) Flexibility for work location (43%) Flexible working hours (42%) Navigating Shifting Business Concerns, Seeking Growth Supply chain disruptions (36%) and rising prices (27%), including energy and commodity prices, are also among the top challenges facing Australian business leaders for the year ahead. To manage supply chain issues, business leaders are making adjustments to inventory and suppliers by strategically stockpiling (50%), replacing or stopping business with certain suppliers (49%), or increasing prices for goods and services (43%). Managing Impacts of the War in Ukraine While the war in Ukraine continues to be a concern across the globe, nearly half (44%) of Australian business leaders expect the conflict to severely impact their business. Of those who do expect to be impacted, nearly 9 in 10 (88%) believe the impact will continue through the end of the year and more than one-third expect to face supply chain issues (45%), higher energy prices (41%) and higher commodity prices (36%) as a result of the war. Elevating What Success Looks Like Through ESG With companies being held to a higher standard with regard to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, more than half (52%) of Australian business leaders expect corporate responsibility to be an increased focus area for their business in 2022. Fortunately, 44% of Australian businesses have a positive outlook on the global focus of ESG, because they believe theyÃÂÃÂre already meeting the requirements. Of the various ESG focus areas, social factors (43%), diversity, equity and inclusion (41%) and environmental factors (37%) were ranked as most important focus areas to their business strategy in the year ahead. Planning for Succession As Australian businesses prepare for the future, many (75%) are planning or considering a transfer of ownershipÃÂÃÂwith over eight in ten (83%) expecting a complete transition within the next five years. For leaders aiming to transition their business, more than half (61%) plan to transfer it to family either through inheritance (28%), sale (26%) or as a gift (7%).

MorganÃÂÃÂs Business Leaders Outlook survey was conducted online from May 24-June 9, 2022.

This work is part of the firmÃÂÃÂs $400 million five-year commitment to improve housing affordability and stability for households of color, particularly in Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The five organizations will work primarily in Inland Empire CA, Rio Grande Valley, TX, Buffalo, NY, Washington, D.C., and Miami-Dade County, FL with a goal to generate a broader impact on a national level. As part of JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs strategy to combat the housing affordability crisis, the firm is supporting organizations advancing innovative housing models that can be successfully scaled throughout the country. Through testing new models and collecting lessons learned, these commitments aim to increase the supply of sustainable and affordable housing for households of color across the U.S., as well as influence key stakeholders in the housing industry, including the public and private sectors. This commitment also reflects how the firm is building on previous experience and insights gained through its unique set of business, data, policy and philanthropic resources to help close the housing affordability gap. The Challenge Against the backdrop of historically high rents and persistent barriers to homeownership rates for communities of color, Americans are facing a housing supply crisis, with a shortage of nearly 3.8 million units nationwide.1 In addition, the climate crisis has adversely affected housing supply, with extreme weather affecting about 1 in every 10 homes in the United States in 2021.2 Low-income Black, Hispanic and Latino households are often concentrated in locations that are highly vulnerable to environmental disasters, subjecting them to effects of the climate crisis and economic uncertainty. ÃÂÃÂIn our efforts to advance an inclusive economy, we remain committed to addressing some of the barriers to affordable housing and homeownership to provide family stability and build generational wealth for households of color,ÃÂÃÂ said Abigail Suarez, Head of Neighborhood Development, JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂMore households deserve accessible options to homeownership and now more than ever we need equitable, sustainable solutions that better equip communities with affordable, climate resilient housing.ÃÂÃÂ Working with Local Partners to Deliver Impact TodayÃÂÃÂs announcement will support organizations working to reverse racial inequities and climate risks embedded in the existing housing system. To address the shortage of energy-efficient and climate-resilient affordable housing, the following organizations will each receive $3 million in philanthropic capital to influence housing construction practices: come dream. come build (cdcb) - Rio Grande Valley, TX: cdcb will expand their MiCASiTA program, which offers affordable sustainable homeownership options for rural families of color. This includes constructing and selling modular homes, lowering the home base sales price to 15% less than a stick-built home, enhancing the modelÃÂÃÂs sustainable features by integrating solar, energy, and water efficiency systems, and expanding into six new locations in other rural Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities. Neighborhood Partnership Housing Services (NPHS) ÃÂÃÂ Inland Empire CA: is building Homes by NPHS, a scalable social enterprise that will increase the supply of affordable housing by building factory-built single-family homes and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on vacant lots, with anticipated savings of 20% in construction costs compared to site-built homes. NPHS will also increase the number of developers of color who can access factory-built housing and incorporate energy-efficient features and weatherization upgrades into factory-built homes in order to help lower pollutants, stay resilient and adaptive against weather, and lower utility costs. ÃÂÃÂNPHS is grateful for JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs investment which will support the use of factory-built housing technology to increase the supply of affordable homeownership and mitigate the impacts of climate change on low-income homeowners,ÃÂÃÂ stated NPHS CEO, Clemente Mojica. ÃÂÃÂThis grant will expand our reach throughout underserved markets and address the systemic obstacles that have historically impeded households of color from achieving and sustaining homeownership.ÃÂÃÂ To help decarbonize affordable housing, the following organizations will each receive $3 million in philanthropic capital to increase the technical knowledge and financing tools in the housing industry to reduce carbon emissions: Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County (SELF) ÃÂÃÂ Miami-Dade County, FL: SELF aims to increase the supply of resilient and sustainable affordable housing by scaling their climate resiliency and clean energy home improvement program to help homeowners, landlords, developers, and contractors of color access innovative funding to rehab homes, upgrade workforce housing and increase green sustainable, affordable housing supply and building expertise. National Housing Trust (NHT) ÃÂÃÂ Washington D.C. Metro Area: NHT aims to promote decarbonization efforts in the Washington DC metro area by involving residents in program and policy design, providing retrofit technical assistance to owners of buildings to improve resident health outcomes, and engaging decisionmakers and lenders to make public resources and mission-driven capital products more accessible and aligned for decarbonizing affordable housing. NHT also aims to have at least 50% of affordable housing rehabilitation projects in the Washington area incorporate yearly decarbonization measures by 2025. PUSH Buffalo ÃÂÃÂ Buffalo, NY: PUSH Buffalo will advance sustainable affordable housing initiatives by building and rehabbing single-family affordable housing with net zero standards and decarbonizing vacant two-unit buildings with green technology for first time homeownership. PUSH Buffalo will also study the health and utility impact of replacing natural gas with electricity in different aspects of affordable homes to understand the resident experience, inform local residents and connect them to new technology and provide data to the wider ecosystem. JPMorgan Chase will work with the Urban Institute to support grantees in the execution of their strategies and in the testing and scaling of their innovations, which will include measuring impact and sharing insights with the housing industry to advance housing stability and affordability for Black, Hispanic and Latino households. ÃÂÃÂI am pleased that Urban has this great opportunity to help these innovative changemakers accelerate solutions. Together with JPMorgan Chase, we will support, collaborate with, and spread insights from this new group of field-leading grantees, who are working to expand and decarbonize the countryÃÂÃÂs housing supply, tackle housing affordability, and address the embedded inequities for households of color in our housing system,ÃÂÃÂ said Urban Institute President Sarah Rosen Wartell. A Firmwide Approach to Supporting Affordable Housing This philanthropic commitment complements the firmÃÂÃÂs sustainability efforts to help advance the transition to a lower-carbon future and support community resilience to the climate crisis, as well as the JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenterÃÂÃÂs housing recommendations to increase equitable access to stable, affordable housing. Additional firmwide efforts to help close the housing affordability gap include: Since 2021, the firm has committed more than $145 million of its $400 million philanthropic commitment to organizations across the country. This includes low-cost loans, equity and grants to advance housing stability and affordability strategies. For example, the firmÃÂÃÂs commitments to Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future and Housing Partnership Network helped support housing stability of low-income households affected by the pandemic. The program disbursed more than $1.7 million to 19 nonprofit housing providers to support services that helped more than 7,800 families remain housed through the pandemic. For example, the firmÃÂÃÂs commitments to Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future and Housing Partnership Network helped support housing stability of low-income households affected by the pandemic. The program disbursed more than $1.7 million to 19 nonprofit housing providers to support services that helped more than 7,800 families remain housed through the pandemic. To help address two of the biggest barriers to achieving homeownership, Chase expanded its Homebuyer Grant program to offer a $5,000 grant to help customers with closing costs and/or down payment assistance when buying a home in predominantly Black, Latino and Hispanic communities across the country. These commitments are part of the firmÃÂÃÂs $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and drive an inclusive economic recovery that was announced in October 2020.

The new hiring commitment will grow Chase Business BankingÃÂÃÂs workforce by 20%. The new employees will help support and grow ChaseÃÂÃÂs five million small business clients through financial advice as well as deposit, credit and cash management products. According to JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs 2023 Business Leaders Outlook, the majority of small business owners expect a recession this year, while nearly all report that inflation has impacted their expenses. Despite this, small business optimism remains high as more than two-thirds of small businesses expect increased revenue and sales in the year ahead, and 65% anticipate greater profits in 2023. ÃÂÃÂSmall business owners are facing difficult challenges with persistent inflation, supply chain disruptions, and expense pressure,ÃÂÃÂ said Ben Walter, CEO of Business Banking, Chase. ÃÂÃÂWe know that banks play a critical role in the long-term success of small businesses and their communities. This investment in our workforce is a testament to our commitment to our clients and our intent to support them through the business cycle.ÃÂÃÂ The new hiring goals add to JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs ongoing commitment to expand access to credit, education and advice to small business owners across the country. Recent efforts include: Expanding access to credit In November 2022, the firm announced a Special Purpose Credit Program to help expand access to credit in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. The program is the first of its kind to be offered for small business owners nationally who might not otherwise be approved for credit or receive it on less favorable terms. Chase also launched a new digital loan application so customers can apply for small business credit online ÃÂÃÂ no need to call or visit a branch. The application is expected to be widely available later this year. Mentorship and advice Last year, the firm expanded its free one-on-one coaching program by hiring 45 trained senior business consultants in 21 U.S. cities to provide mentoring and advice to Hispanic, Latino and Black business owners on everything from boosting creditworthiness to managing cash flow to effective marketing. Since launching its mentorship program in 2020, the firm has mentored more than 2,600 business owners, helping them improve their operations, grow revenues, and network with others in the local business community. New Signature Events In an effort to better engage small business owners in key U.S. cities and increase access to education and advice, Chase is hosting a series of small business bootcamps, ÃÂÃÂThe ExperienceÃÂÃÂ, in Miami, Phoenix and Denver. These all-day events offer local small business owners workshops, expert panels, networking opportunities and live entertainment to celebrate and support local business owners as they market, grow and sustain their business. Investing in Small Business Tech The firm continues to invest in business owners and founders in underrepresented communities across the country. As part of JPMorgan ChaseÃÂÃÂs $10 million, five year commitment to Tech Equity Miami announced last year, JPMorgan Chase also announced today that is has awarded the first $2 million of that commitment to four Miami-based organizations ÃÂÃÂ including BrainStation, CodePath, Rebrand Cities, and YWCA of South Florida, in partnership with gener8tor. These organizations help remove barriers to entry for people of color in the tech industry by increasing access to technical skills and knowledge among small business owners and job seekers. The hybrid experiences will include web development and audit services, social media strategy education, mentorship and other opensource training resources.

The Summerhill Community Center, located at 9 Georgia Ave SE ÃÂÃÂ at the corner of Hank Aaron Drive ÃÂÃÂ aims to expand access to banking, tools and advice that helps customers get on a path to financial health and resilience. The branch features a strong team of local financial health experts focused on community engagement, mentorship and advice. The location looks and feels different from a ÃÂÃÂtypicalÃÂÃÂ bank ÃÂÃÂ it combines a modern design, spacious layout, and the latest banking technology, reflecting how customers engage with Chase today. Offerings include: Specialty financial health workshops on topics such as budgeting, credit and homeownership, for both individuals and groups Free one-on-one mentorship support to help local entrepreneurs grow, start or expand their small business A community ÃÂÃÂliving roomÃÂÃÂ area to serve as event space for partner nonprofits Complementary Wi-Fi for community groups and individuals on-site All Community Center branch programming is complementary and open to Chase customers and non-customers alike. This community-inspired bank model is part of the firmÃÂÃÂs $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close the racial wealth gap. ÃÂÃÂAtlantaÃÂÃÂs growth and prosperity in recent years has exceeded all expectations, but more people need to be part of the opportunity this city represents,ÃÂÃÂ said Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan Chase. ÃÂÃÂOur Summerhill Community Center branch is our stake in the ground to fuel opportunity for more residents, especially underserved populations. At the same time, we are also growing our presence here through jobs and branches, which will have a direct impact on strengthening the local economy.ÃÂÃÂ To build the new Summerhill Community Center, Chase contracted with FS 360, a Black-owned building firm in Atlanta. FS 360 also built the Chase Lounge at the Russell Center and has since built more than seven spaces for Chase in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. The cost of construction for a new branch ranges from about $1 - 1.5 million per branch, and all labor and resources are locally sourced when possible. ÃÂÃÂThe opening of this center provides a physical space for the community to tend to their financial health, grow their small businesses and more,ÃÂÃÂ said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. ÃÂÃÂThank you to Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase for their partnership in assisting our AdministrationÃÂÃÂs vision of building stronger neighborhoods.ÃÂÃÂ To better engage with community members, Chase has hired talented professionals from the Atlanta metro area in new roles to the bank including: Community Managers, Mathilda Lambert, a lifelong Atlanta native, will engage the Summerhill community and its surroundings to increase awareness of financial health resources, and host interactive programs on topics such as goal setting, budget building and understanding credit. Lambert is one of four Community Managers in the Atlanta metro region. Branch Manager, Kevin Brown, a 26 year resident of Atlanta and a 9 year veteran of Chase, will oversee all aspects of the Summerhill branch including traditional banking services and local community engagement. Senior Business Consultants, Rashida Winfrey and Shea Taylor, will provide access to complementary 1:1 business coaching, technical assistance and advice to hundreds of Atlanta entrepreneurs and minority small business owners on everything from boosting creditworthiness to managing cash flow to effective marketing. ÃÂÃÂThe Summerhill Community Center may look like just a building to some, but for othersÃÂÃÂthose who have not had access to financial health and support resources ÃÂÃÂ it represents possibility and opportunity,ÃÂÃÂ said Brigitte Killings, ChaseÃÂÃÂs Community and Business Development Director for the South. ÃÂÃÂWe look forward to delivering on the promise this Community Center branch represents for the people of Summerhill and the city of Atlanta.ÃÂÃÂ Our Community Impact Since 2021, the firm has made more than $10.5 million in philanthropic commitments in the region ÃÂÃÂ including a $2.4 million commitment to Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership (ANDP) announced in 2022. Using the funds from JPMorgan Chase, ANDP is developing 173 affordable single-family homes for homeownership. Of the 50 homes sold to date, nearly 50% of the homebuyers earned 80% or less of the area median income and nearly 90% of the buyers were Black or Latino. In addition, as the official bank sponsor of the Atlanta Hawks, the two organizations have partnered on multiple community-focused initiatives including: Project Rebound: Chase is the presenting sponsor of this initiative which provides basketball and fitness equipment to youth organizations and schools in high needs communities. Second Chance: The Hawks and Chase have also partnered to provide funding for the Center for Employment Opportunities, an Atlanta-based nonprofit which provides employment services for people with past records in Atlanta. ÃÂÃÂOur partnership with Chase goes well beyond the walls of the arena into communities like Summerhill and throughout greater Atlanta,ÃÂÃÂ said Grant Hill, Vice Chair of the Board of the Atlanta Hawks. ÃÂÃÂChase demonstrates its commitment to Atlanta daily through our joint initiatives like Project Rebound and Second Chance, both of which strengthen AtlantaÃÂÃÂs underserved people and communities. We look forward to seeing that commitment grow through this space and the people in it.ÃÂÃÂ Serving AtlantaÃÂÃÂs Small Businesses According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, Georgia is home to 1.1 million small businesses ÃÂÃÂ more than 1/3 of which are minority-owned. A core function of the Atlanta Community Center is supporting those businesses and helping them grow and succeed. In 2021, Chase launched a program to support minority entrepreneurs and hired Senior Business Consultants in 21 cities, including Atlanta, to provide minority business owners with free one-on-one advice and coaching. Since its launch, the small business mentorship program has mentored 4,000 minority business owners, including Atlanta's hometown coffee brand, Hot Coffee, and hosted over 1,200 events. ÃÂÃÂBuilding a relationship with my bank has opened opportunities for me to grow and manage my business that I might not otherwise have had,ÃÂÃÂ said Kat Taylor, founder and CEO of Hot Coffee. ÃÂÃÂAs my business has grown, my Senior Business Consultant was able to connect me with other small business owners facing similar challenges as well as experts in things like bookkeeping and accounting, enabling me to focus my time on marketing my products and serving my customers.ÃÂÃÂ Growing in Atlanta Chase also announced it plans to open 15 more branches to greater Atlanta, bringing its total to 110 branches by 2024. Approximately 30 percent of these branches will be in low-to-moderate income communities. The firm also plans to grow its workforce locally by one-third by hiring 500 new employees by the end of 2025. To accommodate this growth, the company is adding 40,000 square feet of office space at the Monarch Tower in Buckhead. New jobs in the market include roles with the firmÃÂÃÂs Atlanta -based technology team - including software engineers, developers, architects, as well as to support and build a new phone-based Personal Wealth Advisors team, among other hiring needs.

(NYSE: JPM), a leading financial services firm based in the United States with assets of $3.7 trillion and operations worldwide.
