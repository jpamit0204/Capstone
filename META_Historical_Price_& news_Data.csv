Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (ÃÂÃÂKSFÃÂÃÂ), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Meta Platforms, Inc. (the ÃÂÃÂCompanyÃÂÃÂ) (NasdaqGS: META). In February 2022, the Company was sued in federal court by a group of online adult entertainers alleging that the Company had demoted or deleted their accounts and posts on Instagram and Facebook, and also internally listed them as ÃÂÃÂdangerous individuals or organizations,ÃÂÃÂ a designation generally reserved for removing ÃÂÃÂterrorist content,ÃÂÃÂ which resulted in reduced click-throughs and substantially reduced visibility of their content, in order to reduce competition with the OnlyFans (ÃÂÃÂOFÃÂÃÂ) online adult platform, for which the CompanyÃÂÃÂs employees allegedly received bribery payments from OF. Recently, the court presiding over that case denied the CompanyÃÂÃÂs motion to dismiss, allowing the case to move forward. KSFÃÂÃÂs investigation is focusing on whether MetaÃÂÃÂs officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to MetaÃÂÃÂs shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws. If you have information that would assist KSF in its investigation, or have been a long-term holder of Meta shares and would like to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-meta/ to learn more.

Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (ÃÂÃÂKSFÃÂÃÂ), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Meta Platforms, Inc. (the ÃÂÃÂCompanyÃÂÃÂ) (NasdaqGS: META). In February 2022, the Company was sued in federal court by a group of online adult entertainers alleging that the Company had demoted or deleted their accounts and posts on Instagram and Facebook, and also internally listed them as ÃÂÃÂdangerous individuals or organizations,ÃÂÃÂ a designation generally reserved for removing ÃÂÃÂterrorist content,ÃÂÃÂ which resulted in reduced click-throughs and substantially reduced visibility of their content, in order to reduce competition with the OnlyFans (ÃÂÃÂOFÃÂÃÂ) online adult platform, for which the CompanyÃÂÃÂs employees allegedly received bribery payments from OF. Recently, the court presiding over that case denied the CompanyÃÂÃÂs motion to dismiss, allowing the case to move forward. KSFÃÂÃÂs investigation is focusing on whether MetaÃÂÃÂs officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to MetaÃÂÃÂs shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws. If you have information that would assist KSF in its investigation, or have been a long-term holder of Meta shares and would like to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-meta/ to learn more.

And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs).ca As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 850.10%, and in the decade from August 2014 to the present, they are up a preposterous 29434.04%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA News and Updates 12/9/2024 NvidiaÃÂÃÂs shares declined today. This action follows ChinaÃÂÃÂs initiated antitrust investigation into the company over its 2019 acquisition of Mellanox. ChinaÃÂÃÂs State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is investigating Nvidia for potential violations of ChinaÃÂÃÂs anti-monopoloy law. 12/6/2024 The European Union is scrutinizing NvidiaÃÂÃÂs business practices and is looking into potential unfair sales tactics like bundling. This investigation could escalate into a formal inquiry, particularly as Nvidia controls 84% of the AI chip market share. 12/5/2024 Nvidia is looking to begin manufacturing its Blackwell AI chips at Taiwan SemiconductorÃÂÃÂs new facility in Arizona (which is still under construction). 12/3/2024 Nvidia has announced a new partnership with the Thai government with the aim of developing cutting-edge AI infrastructure for the country. 11/27/2024 Nvidia is reportedly prioritizing SamsungÃÂÃÂs GDDR7 memory for its upcoming GeForce RTX 50 series of graphics cards for desktops and AI notebooks. 11/26/2024 Nvidia has been working with a team of global researchers on a groundbreaking AI model, Fugatto (short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1). This versatile tool can generate or transform audio in countless ways: it can create music from simple text prompts, alter a singerÃÂÃÂs emotion or accent, and add or remove instruments from existing songs. 11/25/2024 NvidiaÃÂÃÂs stock declined by nearly 4% today, reaching a three-week low. 11/22/2024 PhillipCapital has downgraded Nvidia from ÃÂÃÂBuyÃÂÃÂ to ÃÂÃÂAccumulateÃÂÃÂ due to recent price swings as the companyÃÂÃÂs Blackwell processors prepare for production. Despite the downgrade, however, PhillipCapital raised the target price for Nvidia from $155 to $160. 11/21/2024 Nvidia reported impressive third-quarter earnings, surpassing analystsÃÂÃÂ expectations. The companyÃÂÃÂs strong performance was largely driven by the robust sales of its high-powered AI chips. Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion, outperforming the projected EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $33.2 billion. 11/20/2024 NvidiaÃÂÃÂs shares dipped by 2% today ahead of the companyÃÂÃÂs much-anticipated earnings report. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, attributed the marketÃÂÃÂs jitters to concerns over NvidiaÃÂÃÂs earnings and geopolitical tensions. NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs share price since 2022. But before 2022ÃÂÃÂs price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companiesÃÂÃÂ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $211.08 billion and $850.01 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs $3.43 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The companyÃÂÃÂs primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies ÃÂÃÂ Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) ÃÂÃÂ account for 40% of NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with ÃÂÃÂcontinuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,ÃÂÃÂ according to Grand View ResearchÃÂÃÂs report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 8.06% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $138.81. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ÃÂÃÂBuyÃÂÃÂ rating on a scale from 1 (ÃÂÃÂStrong BuyÃÂÃÂ) to 5 (ÃÂÃÂStrong SellÃÂÃÂ). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall StreetÃÂÃÂs forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions How NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income and EPS rise 99%, 111.66% and 111.54%, respectively. That would result in a share price of $137.50, or -0.94% higher than where the stock is currently trading. Our high-end price target is $192.50, while our low-end price target is $82.50. When 2026 concludes, we forecast NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue to be $168.151 billion resulting in a net income of $95.246 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $191.50, representing a gain of 37.96% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $268.10, while our low-end price target is $114.90. When 2027 concludes, we forecast NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue to be $193.85 billion resulting in a net income of $108.182 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $222.00, representing a gain of 59.93% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $310.80, while our low-end price target is $133.20. When 2028 concludes, we forecast NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue to be $225.462 billion resulting in a net income of $130.155 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $264.00, representing a gain of 90.19% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $369.60, while our low-end price target is $158.40. When 2029 concludes, we forecast NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs revenue to be $236.498 billion resulting in a net income of $152.001 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $308.00, representing a gain of 121.89% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 160.79% increase over todayÃÂÃÂs share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

(NASDAQ: META) is now a household name because of the foundational success it experienced in social media. But it has been over a decade since its IPO on May 18, 2012, As the only company in the ÃÂÃÂMagnificent SevenÃÂÃÂ that has yet to undergo a stock split, an investor who purchased $1000.00 worth of META stock on the day it went public at $38.00 per share would now be sitting on an investment worth $15810.53, good for a gain of 1481.05%. But since its IPO date, a lot has changed. For starters, on Feb. 1, 2024, the company announced ÃÂÃÂ alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback ÃÂÃÂ that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.33% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.50 per share quarterly, or $2.00 per share annualized. META is the dominant player in the social media landscape but it is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall Street price predictions and forecasts for 2025-2030. Key Points in This Article: ÃÂÃÂMeta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,ÃÂÃÂ according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall Street projects a 65.61% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

Recent Meta Stock Updates and News 12/20/2024 MetaÃÂÃÂs stock fell 1.73% today amid a positive day for the broader stock market. This marks the fourth consecutive day of losses for Meta. 12/18/2024 Emarketer has forecasted that Instagram will generate $32.03 billion in U.S. advertising revenue next year, a substantial 24.4% increase from 2024. This projected growth will solidify InstagramÃÂÃÂs position as the primary driver of MetaÃÂÃÂs U.S. ad revenue, marking the first time it surpasses the 50% threshold. 12/16/2024 MetaÃÂÃÂs Ray-Ban smart glasses are getting smarter, with the latest update (v11) introducing AI-powered video recording and real-time language translation. These features are now available to early access program members. 12/13/2024 MetaÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂVideo SealÃÂÃÂ technology aims to address the issue of AI-powered scams and deepfake technology. The companyÃÂÃÂs new technology allows users to watermark AI-generated videos, making it easier to identify and prevent the spread of manipulated content. 12/12/2024 Meta has donated $1 million to the inaugural fund of President-elect Donald Trump. Interestingly, just a few months ago Trump also threatened to send Zuckerberg to prison for life. 12/11/2024 The Australian government has successfully compelled Meta to adhere to the News Media Bargaining Code, requiring the company to continue compensating Australian publishers for their journalism. 12/9/2024 Prosecutors in Italy have concluded an investigation into Meta for alleged tax evasion of ÃÂÃÂ887.6 million, which was centered around two executives of MetaÃÂÃÂs Irish unit. Next, the prosecutors will file a formal request for trial unless the accused can successfully prove their innocence. 12/6/2024 Meta reached a new all-time high today following a U.S. appeals court ruling. The court upheld a law mandating that ByteDance, TikTokÃÂÃÂs Chinese owner, divest the app by early 2024 or face a potential ban. This decision could potentially boost Meta due to a decline in TikTokÃÂÃÂs user base and advertising revenue. 12/5/2024 Meta announced a new partnership with filmmaker James CameronÃÂÃÂs technology company, Lightstorm Vision. This collaboration aims to revolutionize the way 3D entertainment is experienced on Meta Quest VR headsets. 12/3/2024 MetaÃÂÃÂs shares are surging today, hitting a new all-time high. The stock rose above its previous record of $601.20.

The primary driver of that growth over the past 10 years has been ad space for the companyÃÂÃÂs social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel, and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality ÃÂÃÂ a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs ÃÂÃÂ 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta PlatformsÃÂÃÂ stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta PlatformsÃÂÃÂ Stock Performance AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms ÃÂÃÂreleased the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and weÃÂÃÂre driving good growth across our apps.ÃÂÃÂ While the market for MetaÃÂÃÂs social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the companyÃÂÃÂs revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. The company said shareholders should expect between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year that will fund a data center capable of powering its AI initiatives. That is likely to continue into next year, with CFO Susan Li stating that the META expects ÃÂÃÂsignificant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.ÃÂÃÂ Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the companyÃÂÃÂs net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, ÃÂÃÂSince 2020, MetaÃÂÃÂs global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across 6 countries.ÃÂÃÂ As part of its net zero plan, Meta PlatformsÃÂÃÂ reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, ÃÂÃÂBy 2030, technology improvements could slash todayÃÂÃÂs prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.ÃÂÃÂ The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg coined the 2023 Meta Platforms ÃÂÃÂyear of efficiency,ÃÂÃÂ and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. MetaÃÂÃÂs free cash flow TTM stands at $49.74, showing that its focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $597.50, which represents a -1.05% upside potential from todayÃÂÃÂs share price of $603.86. Of all the analysts covering META stock, it receives a consensus ÃÂÃÂBuyÃÂÃÂ rating with a score of 1.5, with 1 being the strongest ÃÂÃÂBuyÃÂÃÂ rating and 5 being the strongest ÃÂÃÂSellÃÂÃÂ rating. 24/7 Wall StreetÃÂÃÂs forecast projects Meta PlatformsÃÂÃÂ stock price to be $603 by the end of 2025, based on the companyÃÂÃÂs ability to sustain its strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency, which in turn will drive its bottom line despite capital expenditures increasing toward its AI objectives. Meta Platforms Price Estimates 2025-2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $161.579 $54.960 $21.18 2025 $183.459 $62.250 $24.12 2026 $205.257 $70.680 $27.71 2027 $226.332 $78.258 $30.42 2028 $245.319 $85.912 $32.38 2029 $268.306 $97.044 $36.54 2030 $274.947 $91.227 $39.70 Revenue and net income in $billions How METAÃÂÃÂs Next 5 Years Could Play Out We estimate the price per share of Meta Platforms to be $692 with revenue jumping over $200 billion for the first time in 2026. EPS expectations are for $27.71 annualized. That stock forecast represents a gain of 15.36% over todayÃÂÃÂs share price. In 2027 we expect METAÃÂÃÂs stock price to reach $760 with net income increasing to $78 billion on the back of free cash flow exceeding $60 billion for the first time. That stock price represents a 26.70% increase over todayÃÂÃÂs share price. 24/7 Wall Street forecasts that METAÃÂÃÂs share price will reach $809 by the end of 2028, as free cash flow surpasses $70 billion. That price per share represents a 34.87% increase from where the stock is trading today. Then in 2029, we estimate that Meta Platforms will reach $79.262 billion in free cash flow, $97.044 billion in net income and over $268 in revenue resulting in a price per share of $914, or 52.37% upside potential from todayÃÂÃÂs share price. METAÃÂÃÂs Price Target for 2030 By the end of the start of the next decade, we forecast that METAÃÂÃÂs stock price will reach $995.00, or 65.87% higher than it is trading for today, despite estimates that net income will pull back slightly from over $97 billion to over $91 billion. Revenue growth will continue, with an estimated 2.48% year-over-year increase from 2029. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $530 -11.64 2025 $603 0.53% 2026 $692 15.36% 2027 $760 26.70% 2028 $809 34.87% 2029 $914 52.37% 2030 $995 65.87% Revenue and net income in $billions ÃÂÃÂThe Next NVIDIAÃÂÃÂ Could Change Your Life If you missed out on NVIDIAÃÂÃÂs historic run, your chance to see life-changing profits from AI isnÃÂÃÂt over.
