The company is already carbon neutral today for its global corporate operations, and this new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact. ÃÂÃÂBusinesses have a profound opportunity to help build a more sustainable future, one born of our common concern for the planet we share,ÃÂÃÂ said Tim Cook, AppleÃÂÃÂs CEO. ÃÂÃÂThe innovations powering our environmental journey are not only good for the planet ÃÂÃÂ theyÃÂÃÂve helped us make our products more energy efficient and bring new sources of clean energy online around the world. Climate action can be the foundation for a new era of innovative potential, job creation, and durable economic growth. With our commitment to carbon neutrality, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that creates a much larger change.ÃÂÃÂ Apple is providing detail on its approach to carbon neutrality with a roadmap for other companies, as industries look to reduce their impact on climate change. In its 2020 Environmental Progress Report ÃÂÃÂ released today ÃÂÃÂ Apple details its plans to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030 while developing innovative carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25 percent of its comprehensive footprint. To support these efforts and beyond, Apple is establishing an Impact Accelerator that will focus on investing in minority-owned businesses that drive positive outcomes in its supply chain and in communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. This accelerator is part of AppleÃÂÃÂs recently announced $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, focused on efforts that address education, economic equality, and criminal justice reform. ÃÂÃÂWeÃÂÃÂre proud of our environmental journey and the ambitious roadmap we have set for the future,ÃÂÃÂ said Lisa Jackson, AppleÃÂÃÂs vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. ÃÂÃÂSystemic racism and climate change are not separate issues, and they will not abide separate solutions. We have a generational opportunity to help build a greener and more just economy, one where we develop whole new industries in the pursuit of giving the next generation a planet worth calling home.ÃÂÃÂ AppleÃÂÃÂs Climate Roadmap AppleÃÂÃÂs 10-year roadmap will lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: Low carbon product design: Apple will continue to increase the use of low carbon and recycled materials in its products, innovate in product recycling, and design products to be as energy efficient as possible. AppleÃÂÃÂs latest recycling innovation ÃÂÃÂ a robot the company is calling ÃÂÃÂDaveÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ disassembles the Taptic EngineÃÂÃÂ® from iPhoneÃÂÃÂ® to better recover key materials such as rare earth magnets and tungsten while also enabling recovery of steel, the next step following its line of ÃÂÃÂDaisyÃÂÃÂ iPhone disassembly robots. The companyÃÂÃÂs Material Recovery Lab in Austin, Texas, which is focused on innovative electronics recycling technology, is now partnering with Carnegie Mellon University to further develop engineering solutions. All iPhone, iPadÃÂÃÂ®, MacÃÂÃÂ®, and Apple WatchÃÂÃÂ® devices released in the past year are made with recycled content, including 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the iPhone Taptic Engine ÃÂÃÂ a first for Apple and for any smartphone. Apple decreased its carbon footprint by 4.3 million metric tons in 2019 through design and recycled content innovations in its products. Over the past 11 years, Apple has reduced the average energy needed for product use by 73 percent. Expanding energy efficiency: Apple will identify new ways to lower energy use at its corporate facilities and help its supply chain make the same transition. Through a new partnership with Apple, the US-China Green Fund will invest $100 million in accelerated energy efficiency projects for AppleÃÂÃÂs suppliers. The number of facilities participating in AppleÃÂÃÂs Supplier Energy Efficiency Program grew to 92 in 2019; these facilities avoided over 779,000 annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions. Last year, Apple invested in energy efficiency upgrades to over 6.4 million square feet of new and existing buildings, lowering electricity needs by nearly one-fifth and saving the company $27 million. Renewable energy: Apple will remain at 100 percent renewable energy for its operations ÃÂÃÂ focusing on creating new projects and moving its entire supply chain to clean power. Apple now has commitments from over 70 suppliers to use 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production ÃÂÃÂ equivalent to nearly 8 gigawatts in commitments to power the manufacturing of its products. Once completed, these commitments will avoid over 14.3 million metric tons of CO2e annually ÃÂÃÂ the equivalent of taking more than 3 million cars off the road each year. New and completed projects in Arizona, Oregon, and Illinois bring AppleÃÂÃÂs renewable capacity for its corporate operations to over 1 GW ÃÂÃÂ equivalent to powering over 150,000 homes a year. Over 80 percent of the renewable energy that Apple sources for its facilities are now from Apple-created projects, benefitting communities and other businesses. Globally, Apple is launching one of the largest new solar arrays in Scandinavia, as well as two new projects providing power to underserved communities in the Philippines and Thailand. Process and material innovations: Apple will tackle emissions through technological improvements to processes and materials needed for its products. Apple is supporting the development of the first-ever direct carbon-free aluminum smelting process through investments and collaboration with two of its aluminum suppliers. Today the company is announcing that the first batch of this low carbon aluminum is currently being used in production intended for use with the 16-inch MacBook ProÃÂÃÂ®. Through partnerships with its suppliers, Apple reduced emissions from fluorinated gases by more than 242,000 metric tons in 2019. Fluorinated gases are used in the manufacturing of some consumer electronics components and can contribute to global warming. Carbon removal: Apple is investing in forests and other nature-based solutions around the world to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Apple is announcing today a first-of-its-kind carbon solutions fund to invest in the restoration and protection of forests and natural ecosystems globally. In partnership with Conservation International, the company will invest in new projects, building on learnings from existing work like restoring degraded savannas in Kenya and a vital mangrove ecosystem in Colombia. Mangroves not only protect the coasts and help support the livelihood of those communities where they grow, but they also can store up to 10 times more carbon than forests on land. Through its work with The Conservation Fund, the World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International, the company has protected and improved the management of over 1 million acres of forests and natural climate solutions in China, the US, Colombia, and Kenya. Apple engages with governments, businesses, NGOs, and consumers around the world to support policies that strengthen environmental protections and the transition to clean energy, which the company sees as a vital component of global climate action. The companyÃÂÃÂs complete plan and how it measures its carbon footprint can be found in its 2020 Environmental Progress Report at apple.com/environment. Progress on its supplier commitments can be found at apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Supplier_Clean_Energy_Program_Update_2020.pdf.

Though it might appear indistinguishable from its predecessor, the new iMac boasts several major upgrades, including a faster IntelÃÂÃÂ® processor, improved webcam, and SSDs that now come standard across the line. There are plenty of exciting customization options as wellÃÂÃÂperhaps none more so than the ÃÂÃÂnano-textureÃÂÃÂ glass feature, which we first saw in the stunning Pro Display XDR. Apple 27"" iMac with Retina 5K Display (10th Gen Core i5, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, Radeon Pro 5300) https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581592-REG/apple_mxwt2ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html Apple 27"" iMac with Retina 5K Display (10th Gen Core i5, 8GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, Radeon Pro 5300) https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581596-REG/apple_mxwu2ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html While itÃÂÃÂs not light years beyond the previous generation, the latest iMac is undoubtedly the most powerful of its kind. Part of that power comes from the latest 10th-generation IntelÃÂÃÂ® Comet LakeÃÂÃÂ processors (available in 6-, 8-, and 10-core configurations) and next-gen AMD graphics, which, along with the now-standardized SSDs, will deliver demonstrably faster speeds and better performance. Additionally, those same superfast SSDs come with massive amounts of storage, starting at 256GB, all the way up to 8TBÃÂÃÂfour times more than the previous generation. Apple 27"" iMac with Retina 5K Display https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581597-REG/apple_mxwv2ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html Customers have been asking for an updated FaceTime camera for a while, and the new iMac finally deliversÃÂÃÂjust in time, too. With a large portion of the population relying on webcams for remote work, having an internal camera that can compete with external devices is a huge selling point. The iMacÃÂÃÂs updated camera features 1080p resolutionÃÂÃÂa first for an Apple webcamÃÂÃÂas well as tone mapping, exposure control, and video face detection (for conferencing only). The end result should be the highest video image quality weÃÂÃÂve ever seen from a FaceTime camera, which could end up being a major benefit to many customers. Apple iMac 27"" 3.6G 10C10G i9 8GB/512GB RP 5300 https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1581860-REG/apple_z0zw_mxwu_46_bh_imac_27_3_6g_10c_10g_i9_8gb_512gb_rp_5300.html Camera and performance aside, the most exciting ÃÂÃÂnewÃÂÃÂ feature might be the optional nano-texture glass coating. Technically, weÃÂÃÂve seen this technology before in the Pro Display XDR, but itÃÂÃÂs a first for the iMac lineup. The nano-texture treatment adds a matte finish to the display, reducing both reflectivity and glare without hindering the overall image quality. ItÃÂÃÂs an optional treatment, one that you donÃÂÃÂt necessarily have to have. But if youÃÂÃÂve ever seen how the Pro Display XDR holds up in sunlight, itÃÂÃÂs gonna be tough to pass up. As with almost all of AppleÃÂÃÂs devices, the new 27"" iMac can be configured to your specific needs. Choose from a bevy of options, including number of processor cores, storage capacity, RAM size, 10-gigabit Ethernet, SD card reader, and more. The deep customization options mean you should have no problem kitting out your ideal iMac. You can customize your very own iMac today at B&H Photo.

Beginning today, Beats 1ÃÂÃÂ® , the flagship global radio station, will be renamed Apple Music 1, and two additional radio stations will launch: Apple Music Hits, celebrating everyoneÃÂÃÂs favorite songs from the ÃÂÃÂ80s, ÃÂÃÂ90s, and 2000s, and Apple Music Country, spotlighting country music. Since Apple MusicÃÂÃÂs launch in 2015, Beats 1 has grown into one of the most-listened-to radio stations in the world, consistently delivering the best in-depth artist interviews, more global exclusives and premieres than anywhere else, and unique programming that produces culture-moving, news-making moments year after year. Throughout its evolution, Beats 1 has established an inherent camaraderie with the artist community and championed human curation and discovery ÃÂÃÂ an approach that will continue across the three stations. ÃÂÃÂFor the past five years, if ever there was a meaningful moment in music culture, Beats 1 was there bringing human curation to the forefront and drawing in listeners with exclusive shows from some of the most innovative, respected, and beloved people in music,ÃÂÃÂ said Oliver Schusser, vice president of Apple Music, Beats, and International Content. ÃÂÃÂNow, Apple Music radio provides an unparalleled global platform for artists across all genres to talk about, create, and share music with their fans, and this is just the beginning. We will continue to invest in live radio and create opportunities for listeners around the world to connect with the music they love.ÃÂÃÂ Beats 1 Now Renamed Apple Music 1 With state-of-the-art studios in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, and London, Apple Music 1 is the center for pop culture conversation and artist-led programming, and the global destination for artists from around the world to release new music, break news, and speak directly to their fans.

Located in the heart of Istanbul, Apple Ba?dat Caddesi will serve as AppleÃÂÃÂs third retail location in Turkey. This two-level destination blends local materials with the latest store design to create an open and fluid space for customers to explore AppleÃÂÃÂs products and services, or participate in free Today at AppleÃÂÃÂ® sessions. ÃÂÃÂWith the opening of Apple Ba?dat Caddesi, weÃÂÃÂre thrilled to build upon the deep and long-standing relationships we have with our customers in Turkey,ÃÂÃÂ said Deirdre OÃÂÃÂBrien, AppleÃÂÃÂs senior vice president of Retail + People. ÃÂÃÂWe canÃÂÃÂt wait to welcome the local community to our newest store in Istanbul and bring them the best of Apple.ÃÂÃÂ To celebrate the opening, Apple will debut Perspektif Istanbul, a six-week Today at Apple program that pays homage to the city and its creatives. Hosted by 20 local artists, the series brings creativity, culture, and technology together into an experience that examines topics and values important to the local community in Istanbul. Attendees will get a chance to join in-person and virtual sessions that include learning about traditional miniature drawing with illustrator Murat Palta, photographing the unseen with Magnum Photos photographer Sabiha ÃÂÃÂimen, or creating a moving portrait with visual artist Sinan Tuncay. The store will also host an exclusive augmented reality (AR) exhibition developed by creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting, and Turkish sound artist O?uz ÃÂÃÂner. The experience transforms the store with an immersive digital installation and includes many other artists participating in Perspektif Istanbul. Using the latest iPad ProÃÂÃÂ® and iPhone 13 ProÃÂÃÂ® with LiDAR, visitors will be able to see ceramic vessels inspired by Ebru ÃÂÃÂ the traditional art of paper marbling ÃÂÃÂ in AR on their screens, and hear unique spatial sound elements. Apple Ba?dat Caddesi brings forward familiar design elements from Apple StoreÃÂÃÂ® locations around the world and Apple Park in Cupertino, California, while integrating locally sourced Aksaray Yaylak granite and Turkish travertine. Housed under a floating carbon fiber roof, the retail location creates an urban oasis in the heart of the city, complete with a large, tree-filled garden. Once inside, visitors will find the video wall and Forum, home to Today at Apple sessions. The upper level is flanked by avenues, where customers can explore AppleÃÂÃÂs latest products and services. The entire space overlooks the exterior of the store through a 32-foot glass curtain, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside. The interior is bathed in natural light through two large skylights that open to allow ventilation. For 30 years, Apple has been a part of the Turkish community, and Apple Ba?dat CaddesiÃÂÃÂs team members look forward to deepening AppleÃÂÃÂs relationship with local customers throughout Turkey. The diverse, 130-person team collectively speaks 14 languages and will welcome its first visitors on Friday, October 22, at 10 a.m. local time. Because the health and well-being of customers and team members is AppleÃÂÃÂs top priority, the store will implement comprehensive health measures. Additionally, visits to Apple Ba?dat Caddesi on opening day will be by appointment only. Customers can choose from available times at apple.com/tr/retail/bagdatcaddesi. Capacity will be limited, so guests may experience wait times before entering the store. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. AppleÃÂÃÂs five software platforms ÃÂÃÂ iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS ÃÂÃÂ provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

We quantify their impact on some of the largest ETFs and Funds. We look at their current prices, past and forecast earnings growth rates to see how much of a thread their current valuation might pose to investors' who currently own them. Meta provides a good example of what happens to a seemingly well valued top stock like these four if they disappoint investors. ETF investors who don't follow individual stocks are most at risk for losses if they aren't aware of the role these stocks play in their portfolios. Woman talking on large mobile phone on sidewalk in city Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images After reading my most recent article, A Look Inside SPY and VOO: What's Changed Since December 31, 2021, a friend asked me if the value of the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) was as concentrated in a small number of mega cap stocks as it is in S&P 500 ETFs discussed in that article. Those ETFs were the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), The SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). A quick look confirmed that QQQ's top 10 holdings are almost identical to those of SPY. The major difference between the two ETFs is that because there are only 100 stocks in QQQ, each stock makes up a far larger percentage of the value of the entire ETF. So QQQ's value is almost twice as concentrated in a handful of stocks as is that of the S&P 500 ETFs. A Look at Major Large Cap ETFs' Top 10 Holdings Reveals that Four Stocks Dwarf the Others the Top 10 in Impact When I looked at the holdings of these two ETFs, I couldn't help but notice the enormous impact that the stocks of only four companies have on the total performance of these ETFs. Those companies are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet. The latter appears twice the list of the Top 10 holdings of both SPY and QQQ as it trades via two different share classes, (GOOG) and (GOOGL). In the discussion that follows, I am counting Alphabet's two share classes as one, as they are the stock of a single company, and their share prices fluctuate in lockstep with the fortunes of that one company, Alphabet. Having looked at the role these four stocks play in the S&P 500 ETFs and QQQ, I wondered how large a role these four stocks play in two other huge, market cap weighted ETFs. Those were the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). When we add together the assets invested in SPY, QQQ, IVV and the total assets invested in VOO, VTI, and VUG while including the mutual funds of which they are share classes, we learn that these funds currently report having $3.123 trillion under management. In the table below, you can see how much the share prices of these four top stocks contribute to the total value and share price of these popular ETFs. Share of 4 top stocks in popular ETFs Vanguard, Invesco, State Street Global Advisors Websites I only use the figures given by SPY in this table, but because VOO and IVV track the identical S&P 500 index, the percentages these four stocks make up of their holdings should be almost identical. SPY reports the weightings of its holdings daily, while VOO only reports them weeks after the fact. After I looked up the AUM of each of these ETFs, including the mutual funds associated with the Vanguard ETFs, I calculated the percentage of their AUM that was invested in just those four stocks. This is what I found: Dollar Amount of Top 4 Stocks in Major Broad Market ETFs Billions invested in 4 top stocks through popular ETFs and Funds Vanguard, Invesco, SSGA, Blackrock. Table by the author. Websites There is whopping $730.1 billion invested in just these four stocks just via these very popular ETFs. And these are only a few ETFs selected because they are among the largest cap weighted ETFs currently trading. There are plenty of other market cap weighted ETFs that also hold a lot of shares of these four stocks. Though the ETFs that track the Tech sector only hold shares of two of these stocks, Apple and Microsoft, those two stocks make up 46% of the entire value of the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and 39.95% of the Vanguard Tech ETF (VGT). Dozens of other smaller but actively traded mutual funds also hold shares of these four stocks, and if they are market cap weighted, these four stocks play a significant role in their price behavior too. The Future Performance of The Market, A.K.A. the S&P 500 Depends Heavily on These Four Stocks When the financial media discuss ""the market"", they are usually referring to the S&P 500. Given the role these four stocks play in that index, we can see what an outsized role these four stocks play in the returns of the market as a whole. They have all seen their prices come down significantly in the past few months as investors have begun to worry about the impact of rising rates on tech stocks. Even though technically Amazon and Alphabet aren't classified in as being in the GICS Technology Sector, most of us do think of them as tech stocks, no matter what some committee somewhere has decreed. The price declines in these stocks has, of course, contributed to the declines in share price that have made the S&P 500 correct and QQQ enter a bear market in the first quarter of 2022. The question we should be asking now is whether the recent price declines these four powerful stocks have experienced have lowered their prices to levels that are healthy enough that investors don't have to fear that one bad earnings report will send them--and thus ""the market""-- plunging even further. So it's time to take a closer look at what investors are expecting from these four stocks going forward. These Stocks Have Been Valued as Growth Stocks But Are They Still Growing Like Growth Stocks? All four of these stocks are considered growth stocks. None of them is to be found in a value index like the one tracked by The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV). So even though I am going to turn to my trusty FAST Graphs to get a sense of what investors expect of these companies going forward, I do it knowing that you can't value growth stocks by applying the kinds of Graham-Dodd valuation formulas to them that you would use for evaluating a mature, slowly growing, dividend growth stock. But can these four stocks really be growth stocks? These four companies have market caps far larger than the GDP of many developed nations. Apple's current market cap is $2.525 trillion. Microsoft's is $2.100 trillion, Amazon's is $1.481 trillion. The combined market cap of Alphabet's two share classes is the biggest of all four at $3.442 trillion. Just how much room there is for these companies to continue growing their earnings at the rate that brought them to their current dominating position. Top Stocks of the Past Have Seen Their Fortunes Dwindle The history of the stock market is the history of top stocks that were considered rock solid citizens of every shrewd investor's portfolio whose fortunes have declines since their years of glory. General Electric (GE), IBM (IBM), and AT&T (T) all held the position Apple holds now. You can see snapshots of what the Top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 were at different times over the past 40 years in this previous article. You can see the video depicting how their fortunes waxed and waned over 40 years here. These faded once-Top-10 companies all hit the limits of how far they could grow. Then they morphed into stocks investors bought for their dividends, since their future growth was likely to be modest. Now they have relatively modest market caps compared to the current top stocks. Apple's market cap is over 26 times larger than that of IBM's $114 billion. Alphabet's is almost 21 times that of AT&T's $166 billion. Both IBM and AT&T were once the top stocks in the S&P 500. The lesson we must take from this is that at some point growth stocks will stop growing. Has that happened to these top four? The Sizes of these Top Four Stocks Currently Dwarf Those of the Other Top 10 Stocks Looking more into the size of the market caps of these four companies, we see something concerning. Because once we move past these top four stocks, the market caps of even other stocks in the S&P 500's Top 10 are far more modest. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), for example, has a market cap of $445 billion. UnitedHealth's market cap is $454 billion. Both are among the 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 Index, but their market caps are roughly only one-seventh of the size of the market cap of Alphabet's combined share classes. A company's market cap is made out of two elements: the number of shares of its stock available to trade and the price those shares trade at. Price is obviously the most volatile component of market cap. So we have to wonder is this huge discrepancy in market cap size due to the superiority of the businesses behind these four top stocks or a sign of overly exuberant investors assigning them prices that make no sense. If the latter is true, then these four stocks pose a serious risk to the market as a whole. Let's look at these four stocks now.

A stoneÃÂÃÂs throw from Hyde Park, Apple Brompton Road features design inspiration drawn from local flora, along with a new slate of community events and seminars to help customers learn, create, and get the most out of their Apple products. ÃÂÃÂWe are thrilled to open Apple Brompton Road in London, a city teeming with energy, history, and cultural diversity,ÃÂÃÂ said Deirdre OÃÂÃÂBrien, AppleÃÂÃÂs senior vice president of Retail + People. ÃÂÃÂThe storeÃÂÃÂs focus on creativity gives our incredible team members the perfect space to share their passion and expertise with Londoners and visitors from around the world.ÃÂÃÂ Special Sessions The store opening kicks off with the global launch of ÃÂÃÂUnited Visions,ÃÂÃÂ an augmented reality experience honoring the creative works of pioneering London poet and painter William Blake. Created for Getty Museum and brought to life through Apple technology, the purpose-built app showcases the possibilities of creativity by reimagining the seminal artistÃÂÃÂs work. Artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting (Tin&Ed) used AppleÃÂÃÂs M1 Ultra chip in the development of the experience, which features a poetic soundtrack by Grammy Award-winning record producer Just Blaze. ÃÂÃÂUnited VisionsÃÂÃÂ can be viewed by customers in-store and by anyone around the world by downloading the ÃÂÃÂUnited VisionsÃÂÃÂ app. Opening weekend festivities will include a panel discussion on the creation of ÃÂÃÂUnited VisionsÃÂÃÂ with Nguyen, Cutting, and Just Blaze, as well as a special performance and Spatial Audio listening session by London artist Nina Nesbitt.

The Store and Team Upon entering Apple Brompton Road, visitors will be greeted by 12 towering Sicilian ficus trees that line the 7-meter floor-to-ceiling windows and entryway. The seating at the base of each planter acts as a social gathering space for visitors, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside, and bringing nature directly into the store. Visitors come through the central arcade, which mirrors the dimensions of the original Brompton Arcade built on the same precise location in 1903. The storeÃÂÃÂs Forum ÃÂÃÂ where free Today at AppleÃÂÃÂ® sessions provide daily creative inspiration and practical skills ÃÂÃÂ features a first for Apple in the UK: a mirrored ceiling that offers depth-enhancing reflections.

ÃÂÃÂApple TV 4K is the ultimate way for Apple users to enjoy their favorite entertainment on the biggest screen in the home, and now it is more powerful than ever,ÃÂÃÂ said Bob Borchers, AppleÃÂÃÂs vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. ÃÂÃÂThe new Apple TV 4K is unlike anything else out there, given its seamless connection to other Apple devices, ease of use, and access to amazing Apple content. It offers something for everyone in the family to love.ÃÂÃÂ A Cinematic Home Theater Experience The next generation of Apple TV 4K is an entertainment powerhouse, bringing the best video and audio capabilities to the biggest screen in the home.

The deep integration of Apple hardware, software, and services with Apple TV 4K unlocks an unparalleled experience that brings the best of the Apple ecosystem to the living room.4 Apple Music offers access to a catalog of over 100 million songs, expertly curated playlists, and music videos through Apple TV 4K.

Apple TV 4K users can enjoy the largest library of workout content in 4K Ultra High Definition with over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations, all led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers. This fall, iPhone users can subscribe to and enjoy Fitness+ in the 21 countries and regions where it is available, even if they donÃÂÃÂt have an Apple WatchÃÂÃÂ®. Users only need an iPhone to sign up, and can then experience Fitness+ on Apple TV, iPhone, and iPadÃÂÃÂ® with onscreen trainer guidance and interval timing, and estimated calories burned will be used to make progress on their Move ring. Fitness+ users with Apple Watch can take their motivation to the next level with personalized real-time metrics that display on Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad. tvOS This fall, new features coming to the Apple TV experience with tvOS 16 include updates to SiriÃÂÃÂ® that will make it even easier for customers to use their voice to control Apple TV and interact with the results.5 Siri on Apple TV features a complete redesign, and will be able to recognize each userÃÂÃÂs voice, so they can easily access their movies, shows, music, games, and apps, and pick up where they left off. By using the Siri Remote and asking ÃÂÃÂWhat should I watch?ÃÂÃÂ users can get tailored recommendations. When wearing AirPodsÃÂÃÂ®, users can say ÃÂÃÂHey SiriÃÂÃÂ to search and enjoy a hands-free way to control Apple TV. Siri support on Apple TV has expanded to Chile, Finland, and South Africa, and will launch in Denmark, Luxembourg, and Singapore later this year, bringing Siri on Apple TV to 30 countries and regions. With iCloudÃÂÃÂ® Shared Photo Library on Apple TV, everyone in the family will be able to enjoy everyoneÃÂÃÂs photos together on the big screen. Cross-device connectivity on Apple TV 4K will enable developers to integrate personalized experiences between their iPhone and Apple Watch apps with Apple TV. Users can continue to enjoy SharePlayÃÂÃÂ by starting a FaceTimeÃÂÃÂ® session on iPhone or iPad and watching a TV show or movie on Apple TV to stay completely in sync ÃÂÃÂ ensuring everyone catches a movieÃÂÃÂs dramatic reveal or a showÃÂÃÂs punchline at the same moment. With shared playback controls, including using the Siri Remote, anyone in the SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. Apple TV 4K as a Smart Home Hub As a home hub, Apple TV 4K securely connects to compatible smart home accessories, including HomeKitÃÂÃÂ® cameras, lights, shades, and more; allows the user to set scenes and control their smart home while away; and ensures that accessories can run automatically. Apple TV 4K is also an essential building block for Matter, the new smart home connectivity standard that enables a wide variety of accessories to work together seamlessly across platforms, helping to fulfill the true vision of a smart home. When viewing a HomeKit camera, Apple TV users can control nearby accessories ÃÂÃÂ such as turning on the outdoor lights ÃÂÃÂ or display multiple cameras at the same time on the TV screen for a more complete view. In addition, HomeKit Secure Video uses the on-device intelligence of Apple TV 4K to privately analyze the video to detect people, animals, cars, and package deliveries.6 With Thread networking support, Apple TV 4K (Wi-Fi + Ethernet) connects compatible Thread-based smart home accessories reliably and securely. Apple TV 4K and the Environment The new Apple TV 4K is designed to minimize its impact on the environment, using nearly 30 percent less power than the previous generation while achieving more powerful performance.7 The efficiency gains of A15 Bionic eliminate the need for an internal fan, resulting in a more compact design and contributing to a 25 percent reduction in carbon footprint over the previous generation. In a first for Apple TV, Apple TV 4K features 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards, which also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder. The thermal module is made with 80 percent recycled aluminum, while the enclosure of the Siri Remote includes 100 percent recycled aluminum. Redesigned packaging removes the outer plastic wrap, and over 90 percent of packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025. The Apple TV 4K lineup is free of mercury, BFRs, PVC, and beryllium. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact. Pricing and Availability The new Apple TV 4K with Siri Remote will be available starting at $129 (US) from apple.com/store, in the Apple StoreÃÂÃÂ® app, and at Apple Store locations. Apple TV 4K is also available through Apple Authorized Resellers and select pay TV providers. Customers can order the new Apple TV 4K beginning today, with availability starting Friday, November 4, in more than 30 countries and regions, including the US. The Siri Remote has the same beloved design and functionality as the previous generation, and adopts USB-C for charging. It is included with the new Apple TV 4K, or can be purchased separately for $59 (US) starting today, and is compatible with all generations of Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD. AppleCare+ÃÂÃÂ® will be available for Apple TV, providing three years of technical support and additional hardware coverage, including unlimited incidents of accidental damage protection. Customers can try out the new Apple TV 4K at an Apple Store and have their questions answered in person. Before their visit, customers are encouraged to check apple.com/retail for information on opening hours and available services at their chosen store. For a limited time, eligible customers who purchase a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or MacÃÂÃÂ® can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ and Apple ArcadeÃÂÃÂ® for free. 1.

Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.

Saul Esquivel is charged with the May 4 armed robbery of a jogger in Wilmette and the May 14 armed robbery of a 7-Eleven in Skokie. Esquivel also faces charges of possessing a stolen vehicle, burglarizing a vape store, fleeing from police on multiple occasions and a misdemeanor firearm offense. At his initial appearance before a judge Friday in Skokie, Esquivel's court-appointed attorney, Assistant Public Defender Vanessa Ficaro, said Esquivel had recently graduated Waukegan High School and lived there with his family. Assistant State's Attorney Patrick Campbell told the judge that Esquivel had identified himself as the person who broke into Lincolnwood Tobacco and Vape, 3942 W. Devon Ave., by smashing the front door with a brick early on the morning of April 13. Officers in Des Plaines tried to pull over Esquivel in a car he was driving April 20 on East Prairie Avenue, according to separate felony charges, but the 18-year-old motorist fled and struck a squad car. Then, on the morning of May 4, Esquivel and an accomplice stole a woman's phone at gunpoint as she went on a morning run on Beechwood Avenue in Wilmette, according to Campbell. The woman told police two masked men, possibly teens, emerged from a black Hyundai sedan. Esquivel's accomplice on this robbery, who he identified as 18-year-old Samnang Toem, demanded the woman unlock the phone and enter her Apple ID, the prosecutor said. When the woman was unable to remember, they got frustrated and Esquivel, the driver, allegedly told Toem to ""just grab the phone"" before they fled. Wilmette police later tracked down the Hyundai to an earlier carjacking in the 4600 block of North Walcott Avenue in Chicago and found footage of the two people who later dumped it in the 3900 block of North Milwaukee Avenue, in which Esquivel identified himself and Toem, the prosecutor said. After waiving his rights against self-incrimination, Esquivel ""related that he likes stealing cars and he was up late the night before and into the morning stealing cars with his friend Sam,"" Campbell said. ""[Esquivel] further related that Sam was upset because his mother took his phone and they decided to rob someone of theirs,"" the prosecutor said. At the time of the Wilmette armed robbery, Toem, of Evanston, was out on pretrial release while awaiting trial in connection with the Dec. 10, 2023, armed robbery of a delivery driver in the 2200 block of Foster Street. Toem was later ordered jailed in connection with a separate armed robbery and he was booked into the Cook County Jail on May 10, according to the sheriff's office. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 23. Esquivel was working with a different accomplice during the Skokie armed robbery. Skokie police were called to the 7-Eleven, 7950 Crawford Ave., for a report of an armed robbery that took place around 12:30 a.m. on May 14. The clerk told police two masked figures came into the store, according to the prosecutor. When he asked them to take their masks off, Esquivel pulled out a gun, racked a round and pointed it at the store employee, demanding cash. When the clerk struggled to open the register, Esquivel told him, ""I'll knock your ---- back."" Esquivel and his accomplice, who he identified as ""Sergio,"" then fled the store while flashing gang signs, according to Campbell. The prosecutor said Esquivel was taken into custody following a pursuit that began when officers with the Glencoe Public Safety Department tried to pull him over in another stolen Hyundai on the southbound Edens Expressway in response to an alert from a Flock Safety automated license plate reader camera at Tower Road. Esquivel exited the freeway and drove through Lincolnwood before driving into Skokie and abandoning the car in the 4900 block of Estes Avenue in Skokie, where he was later found hiding under a bush. He later told police that car was the fourth one that he had stolen that night, according to the prosecutor. ""He has clearly shown that he is a volatile and violent individual with little regard to the law, has ran from the police on multiple occasions, as was noted in the other cases, even running into a police car as he fled,"" Campbell told the judge, arguing against the defense's request for house arrest in Waukegan ""[Esquivel] has made statements that he hangs out with Latin King gang members, he gets guns from Latin King gang members, he sells stolen cars to Latin King gang members and I don't think, given his behavior, an ankle monitor would stop him from stealing cars ÃÂÃÂ and he's stolen multiple cars ÃÂÃÂ and using them in armed robberies,"" he said. Cook County Associate Judge Anthony Calabrese determined there were no conditions of pretrial release that could mitigate the threat to the community that Esquivel poses. ""We have an individual who, in broad daylight,"" Calabrese said, ""in Wilmette, commits an armed robbery, in which a citizen is simply out on her own, enjoying a jog when a stolen sedan pulls up ÃÂÃÂ and the individuals get out and they point a silver handgun to her head.""

It was in December that a Middletown Police detective first received a report that McGhee was having an inappropriate relationship with a student, according to an affidavit the Monmouth County Prosecutor released Thursday. That first allegation did not name the student, according to the affidavit. On Jan. 26 that same detective received another report, this time from a Middletown school official, and alleging McGhee had inappropriate contact with a student. The school district received word of the allegations via email, said police. According to the affidavit, after the second allegation was made, Middletown Police discovered a report of a ""suspicious"" incident in another town, where McGhee was found with a teenage girl in a car after midnight. The teen girl, under the age of 18, was enrolled in the Middletown public school system. Middletown Police then interviewed the girls' parents and then the girl herself, who told police she and the teacher had been involved in a relationship that turned sexual, according to the affidavit. Middletown Police also interviewed McGhee at Middletown Police headquarters, who ""confessed to the sexual relationship with the student, specifically stating that the encounters sexual in nature occurred in the basement of his house,"" according to the affidavit. McGhee, who lives in Ocean Township, was arrested Tuesday and taken to the Monmouth County jail. He is charged with second-degree sexual assault and second-degree child endangerment. McGhee is also a gym/health teacher at Middletown North, and an assistant football coach for the Middletown North Lions. The district placed him on paid administrative leave after he was arrested, pending the outcome of the criminal charges against him. The inappropriate relationship between McGhee and the teen began late last year, allege Middletown Police. His Apple iPhone and Apple Watch were also seized by Middletown Police to be searched for evidence. Wednesday's report: Middletown North Basketball Coach Charged With Sex Assault Of Student Patch incorrectly reported in an initial version of this story that Middletown Police did not investigate the first allegation in December. That is incorrect, said the Monmouth County ProsecutorÃÂÃÂs Office. They did investigate. Middletown Police released this statement Thursday night after this article was published: On January 30, 2025, Patch published an article titled ÃÂÃÂMiddletown Police Notified Twice of Sex Allegations Against Teacher,ÃÂÃÂ with a phrase in the first paragraph erroneously reporting that the Middletown Township Police Department failed to investigate the initial report that led to criminal charges being filed in this case. That is demonstrably false. While Patch has since reworded this portion of the article and also published a correction, additional clarification is now necessary. The rush to publish this article before fact checking and final approval by the reporter and or editorial staff proved to be irresponsible journalism. Due to the ongoing nature of this investigation, Middletown Twp. Police cannot comment on case-specific facts and events that led to the arrest of Justin McGhee, 35, of Ocean Twp. However, the initially published portrayal of the investigation in this article was highly speculative and again, inaccurate. Upon receipt of the initial report, police initiated an investigation. However, due to the very limited information provided there was insufficient evidence to indicate that any crime had been committed. Furthermore, at no time did any of the information provided to the police identify the victim, nor did either report indicate that McGheeÃÂÃÂs actions were sexual in nature. Ultimately, upon receipt of the secondary report, police were able to go forward with the investigation, which culminated in the arrest of McGhee, less than 24 hours later. Middletown Police Police Chief R. Craig Weber stated, ÃÂÃÂThis agency takes crimes of this nature very seriously and thoroughly investigates each and every tip or allegation of criminal activity to the fullest extent possible. Any report or suggestion to the contrary is patently false. This police department will always take every step necessary to safeguard and protect the community.ÃÂÃÂ Anyone with additional information pertaining to this investigation is urged to contact Detective Ricardo Cruz at (732) 615-2120 or Monmouth County ProsecutorÃÂÃÂs Office Det. David Sidorakis at (800) 533-7443.
