Campaign to Share Diverse Stories of Personal Strength, in All Its Forms","CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On Sunday night, Secret Deodorant is debuting its newest campaign starring a diverse celebrity line-up of women across entertainment, sports, business and fitness. This campaign gives much-needed air-time to the personal stories of modern women who are challenging the status quo in their respective fields. With the release of its ?All Strength, No Sweat? campaign, Secret Deodorant, a brand committed to driving actions in support of equal representation, equal compensation and equal opportunity for all women, is once again shining a spotlight on inspirational women who are pursuing their passions without ?sweating? the obstacles in their paths. The campaign video, which will air nationally through 2020, features a song written and performed by singer/songwriter and Grammy-nominee Jessie Reyez, who stars in the video. Also featured within the campaign are actress Camila Mendes, Olympic Gold Medalist Swin Cash, actress and entrepreneur Shenae Grimes-Beech and fitness mega-influencer Ainsley Rodriguez. The lyrics were inspired by the brand?s original ?All Strength, No Sweat? platform from February 2019 and serve as a rallying cry for women of all kinds, encouraging them to take pride in their power, their attitude and their right to claim what they deserve in life ? whether that?s fighting for a seat at the table, in the boardroom, or acting as a positive example to women in Hollywood. ?Secret has a history of supporting women?s progress and telling stories of women?s strength, which is something that I feel equally passionate about,? said Jessie Reyez. ?As a woman in the music industry, I?ve experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to make headway in such a male-dominated field. I?m honored to be a part of this campaign and share Secret?s goal of equalizing opportunity for women everywhere. I hope our stories connect with other women out there and we can continue to inspire and lift up one another.? Secret is releasing a series of shorts featuring the unique perspectives and personal stories of each of the five women appearing in the campaign, including: Jessie Reyez: This Grammy-nominated Canadian/Colombian singer and songwriter has become a powerful role model for women in music. Reyez gets candid about the challenges she has faced in the music industry, revealing a very personal story from her past. Camila Mendes: A Brazilian-American actress who stars as Veronica Lodge on the CW?s highly popular series Riverdale, Mendes is the face of the brand?s new Secret with Essential Oils collection. As fierce as she is feminine, Mendes shares how she is using her voice as a force of change in Hollywood. Swin Cash: Having made the leap from WNBA player and Olympic gold medalist to bona fide businesswoman, Cash ? currently the VP of Basketball Operations and Team Development for the New Orleans Pelicans ? speaks out about equal representation for women, in sports and in life. Shenae Grimes-Beech: A mother, actress, content-creator and self-proclaimed ?queen of keeping it real,? Grimes-Beech reveals her own ?unfiltered? experiences in motherhood, helping to show other women that they are not alone in navigating the unknown. Ainsley Rodriguez: This fitness guru from Miami, who?s amassed almost two million followers on Instagram through sharing her workouts, nutrition tips and her followers? body transformations, believes the most powerful muscle you can train is your mind, and that from there, results follow. Rodriguez shares with Secret her commitment to helping women stay strong mentally and physically through life?s challenges, big and small. ?We?re so proud to be working with such a diverse group of inspiring women, all of whom were chosen for their unwavering strength and relentless approach to getting what they want from life,? said Sara Saunders, Associate Brand Director, Secret. ?We hear from incredible women every day ? about their concerns, their ambitions, and about their work to earn their fair share at every stage and place in life. Our hope is that by spotlighting a few of these stories, we can continue to inspire strength and unity in making a real change together.?

Dish Spray. Since the 1970?s, liquid Dawn dish soap has helped millions of Americans tackle kitchen clean-up after a messy meal. The brand regularly researches consumer habits, and according to that research the way people do dishes has slowly been changing since the brand launched more than 50 years ago. Today, more than half of Americans say they clean the dishes as they prepare food, instead of waiting for one big post-meal clean-up. ?Cleaning as you go is something we do all around our homes today to try and stay ahead of the mess,? says Kristine Decker, Brand Director for North America Dish Care at Procter & Gamble. ?We saw this increasing trend as an exciting opportunity to invent a product designed to make cleaning dishes as you go faster and easier, so people can spend less time at the sink, and more time doing what?s important to them.? Dawn?s innovation team spent more than five years designing a new spray-foam formula that works on contact to remove food from dishes. While traditional dish soap needs to be combined with water to form suds, with Dawn Powerwash no water is required until the final rinse. The sprayer features a first-of-its-kind nozzle with a spray chamber that mixes the product with air to create suds that spread evenly over surfaces, loosening burnt-on, baked-on messes. The new, unique formula eliminates the need to soak dishes overnight, and studies show that it delivers five times faster grease cleaning than non-ultra Dawn. The design transforms the dishwashing experience, with three simple steps: spray, wipe, rinse. Dawn Powerwash? Dish Spray is designed as a refill model, with a reusable sprayer that disconnects from an empty bottle and can be easily attached to a 16 oz. refill. This design allows consumers to make a one-time purchase of a ?Starter Kit? with a sprayer and bottle, and then buy a refill in one of three scents: Fresh, Apple and Citrus. Dawn Powerwash & Celebrity Chef Curtis Stone With Dawn Powerwash? Dish Spray, cleaning as you go is easier than ever. To prove it, the brand is partnering with award-winning chef Curtis Stone of Bravo?s Top Chef Masters and TLC?s Take Home Chef, and currently, Field Trip with Curtis Stone on PBS, to clean as he cooks with Dawn Powerwash? Dish Spray. ?One of the first things that I learned at culinary school is the ?clean as you go? rule, which prevents messes from building up and removes clutter in the kitchen,? says Stone. ?But sometimes burnt-on messes can be tough to clean without a proper soak. With Dawn Powerwash? Dish Spray, there?s finally a product that will help professional chefs and at-home chefs alike keep their sink empty and kitchen clean so once the prep is done, so are the dishes.? Together, Dawn and Curtis Stone are introducing a three-part recipe series, with each recipe designed to easily clean as you go, letting you sit down and enjoy the meal without kitchen clean-up hanging over your head. The recipe series focuses on some of the year?s most popular cooking occasions?and each recipe is specifically designed to make a mess, so you can see Dawn Powerwash? Dish Spray in action! In the midst of football season, Chef Stone will share how to make his favorite Ribeye Steak Sandwich with Caramelized Onions and how to clean as you go, so you don?t miss a single play. On Valentine?s Day, Chef Stone will help you make your loved one a romantic Parisian breakfast featuring his beloved Croque Madame recipe. Cold temperatures and snowy afternoons call for cozy meals inside. Curtis Stone?s Orecchiette with Roasted Vegetables, Lemon, and Brown Butter will help you heat up the kitchen this winter. The recipes will be available at www.dawn-dish.com beginning in late January. About Dawn Dawn, America?s #1 dish liquid*, has been helping people clean since 1972. While most people know Dawn as the dish soap that best cuts grease in the sink, it?s also the ultimate secret weapon for cleaning greasy messes throughout the home.

Starring U.S. soccer players Carli Lloyd and Crystal Dunn, this ad is the latest from Secret to prominently highlight women?s social issues. ?More than two-thirds of girls believe that society doesn?t encourage women to play sports,? said Sara Saunders, Associate Brand Director, Secret. ?We?re setting out to change this notion by spotlighting world-class female athletes on a field where gender equality is not yet the norm. Whether or not a woman wants to play football, shouldn?t she at least be able to consider it a possibility? We believe that there are some things women shouldn?t have to sweat ? and equal opportunity is one of them.? The spot opens with a typical football game day scene: a packed stadium, enthusiastic fans, players taking to the line of scrimmage before a make-it-or-break-it kick. Things quickly take a turn for the unexpected when, following a successful kick, the kicker and holder are revealed to be women ? specifically, Lloyd and Dunn. The crowd goes wild, as Secret issues a call-to-action: Let?s Kick Inequality. ?I am so incredibly proud to be a part of this campaign, and I am thrilled that a brand like Secret is bold enough to make a statement like this during such a major moment in sports,? shared Lloyd. ?While I?ve been vocal about my ambitions to play football professionally, this message is so much bigger than football ? it?s about showing to women and girls that it?s okay to set big goals for themselves and to aspire to be more than what they think is possible. I want to show people what a truly equal world can look like, and ?The Secret Kicker? does just that.? This territory is not new to Secret, which has a long history of supporting women?s progress. Added Saunders, ?Secret has been championing strong women for more than 60 years, and as part of that, we?re committed to doing our part to advocate for positive change.? Following its debut on ?Ellen,? Secret will launch its first-ever YouTube Masthead on January 28. The brand has also enrolled a number of high-profile celebrities, athletes and influencers to help share this message with their followers and join Secret in its push to #KickInequality. This work will culminate in a pre-game airing on Sunday, February 2, approximately ten minutes before the Super Bowl kick-off. ?The Super Bowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world, and we are excited that brands like Secret continue to use this moment to share such important messages with our audience,? said Samantha Rapoport, Senior Director of Diversity & Inclusion at the National Football League. ?Throughout the NFL, we welcome passionate players of all backgrounds and of any gender to be part of our team both on and off the field. We are proud to stand with Secret to celebrate the progress that has been made and to show everyone what the future of football could look like.?

Not only does Microban 24 kill 99.9% of bacteria on contact, but it also keeps working throughout the day. Microban 24 provides a protective shield that keeps killing bacteria for a full 24 hours, even when the surface is touched or contacted multiple times. Bacteria can survive on surfaces anywhere from several hours up to several days. In fact, under ideal conditions bacteria can grow and multiply every 20 minutes. The bacteria living on the surface are transferred to people through contact so anything we touch can possibly be a bacteria-contaminated surface. According to a recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll, 84% of Americans believe that their current household antibacterial products provide some level of lasting antibacterial protection beyond the moment of application2. What they don?t know is that many disinfectants allow bacteria to be reintroduced to surfaces after being touched. ?People deserve an antibacterial product that works as hard as they do to shield their home from the spread of bacteria,? said Martin Hettich, VP North America Home Care, P&G. ?The antibacterial surface category hasn?t seen a true product innovation in a long time; we want to push beyond the status quo and offer families a new sanitizing product that keeps working around the clock. Now, they can rest easier knowing our breakthrough technology is hard at work, even when they?re not cleaning.? The power behind Microban 24?s proven technology relies on a unique, multi-layer protective shield that forms wherever you apply it and allow to air dry. This multi-layer shield then activates small amounts of bacterial fighting ingredients over time, providing continuous antibacterial protection for up to 24 hours when used as directed. ?I work in a salon and also have children at home, so for me to be able to clean something and then forget about it for 24 hours is amazing,? said Jennifer G., a consumer from Microban 24?s early test market. ?I spray it at night before I go to sleep, and then the next day it?s good for everyone who?s cycling through.? Microban 24 is available in three different forms: a Sanitizing Spray, a Multi-Purpose Cleaner, and a Bathroom Cleaner in both Fresh Scent and Citrus Scent. The Microban 24 product lineup is now sold at major retailers nationwide as well as online. To learn more, please visit Microban24.com. Follow Microban 24 on Instagram and Facebook at @Microban24 for tips and tricks on how to get the most out of your cleaning products, as well as updates on future innovations and offerings. 1 Microban 24 provides continuous protection against the Enterobacter aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, for up to 24 hours when used as directed. 2 This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of P&G from March 21-25, 2019 among 2,040 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

As part of this effort, P&G is donating $1 million to support the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies? (IFRC) COVID-19 appeal, as well as individual European Red Cross Red Crescent national societies? efforts, to improve the lives of Europe?s vulnerable people across the continent during these challenging times. Since the onset of the outbreak, P&G has been working with long-standing partner organizations to understand how to best support communities, relief agencies and those impacted by this global emergency. Today, we are taking three immediate actions to support urgent public needs. Supporting vital health care services: We will donate an initial one million dollars to the IFRC and Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies to provide health care, medical supplies and hygiene education to vulnerable people across Europe. IFRC Regional Director for Europe (ad interim), Elkhan Rahimov, said the donation would enable Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff across Europe to continue their vital and lifesaving work on the frontline of the COVID19 response. ?In these times of great emergency, this support will enable us to keep helping the most vulnerable in our society. Older people and immune compromised, those in quarantine and isolation, migrants and the homeless. We are truly appreciative of Procter and Gamble?s support,? Mr Rahimov said. Improving lives at home with everyday essentials: Everyone at P&G is working diligently to maintain the production, distribution and availability of all our brands, not only for consumers but also for the comfort and confidence of the medical workers, emergency services and first responders who are on the frontline of the battle against COVID-19. We are also working with Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies and local foodbanks, to deliver everyday cleaning, health and hygiene essentials to those who need it most. During these unprecedented times, our brands enable people to do the simple things ? brush their teeth, wash their hair, shave, wear a clean shirt, change a baby diaper, keep homes and clothes clean ? actions that can help restore a sense of normalcy and improve everyday life and wellbeing. Providing hand and surface sanitizers: We are shifting manufacturing to help protect frontline workers. We recently started producing sanitizer in several P&G manufacturing sites in Europe, to ensure our people can continue operating safely and supporting hospitals, health authorities and relief organizations. We are building capacity to provide a minimum of 10,000 litres of hand sanitizer in 16 countries around Europe, enabling more than 3 million hand washes per week. Loic Tassel, P&G President, Europe said, ?In 30 years of working in the consumer goods industry, I have never experienced such challenging times impacting far more than businesses, but our neighbours, our communities ? every facet of our lives. The P&G team is committed to doing everything possible to ensure the health and safety of all our employees, to continue to serve our consumers with essential products and services and to take meaningful action to help communities in need and those on the frontlines. Together, P&G and its organization partners are stepping up as a force for good in service to our communities.?. We cannot predict how and when this crisis will end but we?re committed to be part of the solution. We have mobilized the full capabilities of P&G and our partners to help out in this time of need, and we will be there for our employees, consumers and communities ? stepping up to be a force for good ? however long it takes. ?

But as two new surveys from P&G Professional reveal, COVID-19 is still top of mind for consumers and it will be critical for businesses to reassure their guests that it is safe to return. Communicating that the space is cleaned and disinfected by brands they know and trust will help instill this consumer confidence. In May 2020, P&G Professional, the away from home division of Procter & Gamble, surveyed 850 frequent business and leisure travelers and 974 diners about how COVID-19 has impacted their expectations about future travel and dining experiences. The surveys revealed that more than 70 percent of hotel guests and 80 percent of diners believe COVID-19 will have a medium to large impact on their expectations, even as nearly 50 percent of each group plans to return to their routines within the next three months. As businesses begin to reopen and welcome people back into their space, transparency around cleaning procedures and the products used can help guests feel more safe and confident and ultimately benefit a business?s bottom line. Seventy percent of travelers and nearly 60 percent (58%) of diners respectively, said they would patronize a hospitality or foodservice establishment if they knew the business was using a manufacturer or brand of cleaning products they personally knew and trusted. In addition, 55 percent of travelers would be willing to pay more for a hotel room and one in three diners would be willing to pay more for a meal if they knew the business was using a personally recognizable and trusted brand of cleaning products. Each survey revealed that P&G Professional is the professional-grade cleaning manufacturer with the highest awareness and trust by respondents with nearly 50 percent saying they have extreme trust in P&G Professional to clean a facility most effectively vs. 38 percent of the next leading competitor. ?For more than 110 years, P&G Professional has offered cleaning solutions that help protect businesses and communities,? said Paul Edmondson, P&G Professional Americas Commercial Director. ?Now more than ever, it is critical that businesses achieve and maintain a high level of cleanliness and disinfection to help ensure the health and safety of employees and guests. Communicating the steps taken to achieve these new standards of clean is key to building trust with customers while rebuilding their business.? P&G Professional has launched the CleanPLUS Experience to aide businesses in their recovery by offering resources and materials to help build trust with guests. Businesses who sign up for the CleanPLUS Experience will have access to co-branded digital and printed materials that showcase trusted name brands such as Dawn Professional, Microban 24 Professional, Safeguard, Spic and Span, and Comet to help give customers and guests confidence in the clean. Travelers Expect More Bathroom cleanliness, odors, visible hair, and the condition of linens are top signals that a guest room is clean, or not Bathroom surfaces, high-touch objects, contamination from previous guests, and presence of invisible pathogens are top concerns Fifty-seven percent expect more transparency around what hotels are doing to keep guests safe and rooms clean, both in-person and on the company website Sixty-seven percent expect to see more thorough and frequent cleaning and 61 percent expect to see more visible methods of cleaning, like pamphlets and signage Cleanliness and housekeeping procedures were ranked as most the important attributes for hotel guests, surpassing both the price of the room and location of the hotel Diners Raise the Bar Bathroom and kitchen cleanliness, spotless tables, chairs and surfaces and pleasant smells were the top signals that a restaurant is clean, or not More than 70 percent expect more thorough and frequent cleaning, saying bathrooms, buffets, tables, chairs and counters are the most important areas to clean Diners support changes to staff procedures to ensure safety, testing sick employees before they return to work, and having employees wear masks and gloves Cleanliness ranked as the second most important attribute for a diner?s experience behind only the quality and taste of food, however, seventy-four percent want to know how restaurants are cleaned and sanitized and what is being done to ensure food safety P&G Professional has many EPA-Approved Products on List N for use against SARS-CoV-2 with trusted brand names.

They want to free their babies from discomfort. From the #1 doctor-recommended probiotic brand for 7 years in a row, Align is excited to introduce Align Baby Probiotic, Colic Relief, for babies newborn . This unique product is the new ?secret weapon? parents can count on for their babies, as it is specially formulated to add good bacteria for a healthy tummy and to help soothe fussiness and crying* for a happy baby. Align has partnered with Jamie Otis, a board-certified RN and mother to a 2-year-old and newborn who swears by the Align Baby Probiotic product. ?As a mom to a new baby and someone constantly in touch with other moms of little ones, a pain point we share is finding the best ways to soothe fussiness in our kiddos,? said Jamie. ?We?ve all been craving that clutch product that will deliver effective, quick relief, and Align Probiotic?s new Baby Probiotic product gets it done.

Safeguard will donate $10 million to promote handwashing habits among kids and provide more underserved communities and families with free hygiene products through organizations including Save the Children, Americares, and Feeding America. A national survey among 1,000 parents conducted by Safeguard revealed nearly seven in 10 parents (68 percent) are concerned about their children exposing others in the household to COVID-19 because of poor hand hygiene, while half (50 percent) of parents are so worried about their children?s hygiene and health that they don?t plan to take their kids to parks or recreation facilities after they reopen. ?We are facing one of the biggest health crises of our lifetime, and unacceptable disparities for children across America are compounded during this pandemic ? making access to basic essentials including hygiene and health items out of reach for far too many children,? said Mark Shriver, Senior Vice President of U.S. Programs & Advocacy at Save the Children. ?We are proud to partner with Safeguard to draw attention to these inequities and catapult change through increased access to education and essential health and hygiene products.? CDC guidelines state handwashing, along with maintaining social distance and wearing masks, is a top preventative practice to stop the spread of germs and decrease the risk of another Coronavirus outbreak.2 Yet, nearly three in four (73 percent) of parents are not completely confident that children will maintain proper handwashing when they are not with them, and 54 percent say their children don?t practice proper handwashing all the time--underscoring the need for effective hygiene education, particularly in communities most impacted by the pandemic. ?Safeguard has been teaching parents and children worldwide how to clean their hands properly through partnerships with health organizations, educators and governments,? said Freddy Bharucha, P&G?s Vice President of North America Personal Care. ?Our creative methods for teaching kids handwashing have been implemented in 15 countries reaching 100 million children over the past 10 years. The global learning from our work helped guide the road map to provide support to U.S. families and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.? The multi-phased initiative counts on the support of various notables and experts that will share personal anecdotes and tips to teach and reinforce how kids can stay healthy. Actress, entrepreneur and new mother, Shay Mitchell, advocates the importance of instilling hand hygiene habits at home starting at an early age. Family physician, Dr. Jen Caudle, has joined the initiative to help parents understand how to follow CDC guidelines and advise how children can safely remain active this summer in support of their mental and physical well-being. Save the Children serves as a catalyst for providing basic health and hygiene resources like hand soap to U.S. communities most in need. Cosmic Kids Yoga and other social media personalities will round out the initiative, reaching children and families to introduce an interactive handwashing routine in the form of a song. In the U.S., Safeguard has traditionally supplied hand hygiene dispensers, soaps and sanitizers for restaurants and other businesses. With the national surge in demand of hand hygiene products, Safeguard is introducing new hand soaps and sanitizers that wash away bacteria and germs into US retail stores. The brand expects to increase manufacturing capacity to 45,000 liters of hand sanitizer per week once fully operational. For more information on how you can safeguard your family and wash away germs, visit: www.pggoodeveryday.com/impact/safeguard-covid-19/ About the Survey The Safeguard Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) between May 26 and May 29, 2020, among 1,000 nationally representative U.S. parents with kids ages two to 12. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. About Safeguard Since it was launched in the U.S. in 1963, Safeguard has been committed to protecting families by washing away germs and bacteria, as well as educating children on proper hygiene habits. Safeguard?s creative approach to teaching kids handwashing has been implemented in 15 countries reaching nearly 100 million children over the past 10 years. Outside the U.S., the brand runs a widely watched cartoon series, Commander Safeguard, which reinforces good handwashing behavior and averages three million Youtube viewers on some episodes.

Sadly, 41% of women are not 100% confident they know how to correctly insert a tampon, according to recent research conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Tampax1. One reason for this confusion is that in the U.S., only 29 states are required to teach sex and reproductive health education and of those, only 22 states require the content to be medically accurate2. Tampax, the leading tampon brand, is working to change that by joining forces with Emmy award-winning comedian and actress Amy Schumer. Together they are on a mission to ensure people understand what is going on with their bodies so they can take control over their periods, feel educated and empowered about using tampons, and have a more comfortable experience. ?We thought a lot about whether or not to kick off this new period education campaign now. While we paused to shift focus to support more urgent needs, we decided that because periods aren?t stopping, we shouldn?t either,? says Melissa Suk, Vice President of North America Tampax and Always. ?When we chose to focus on tampon and period education, we knew Amy Schumer was a perfect fit because Amy doesn?t shy away from anything. Our goal is to make period and tampon conversations as normal as periods and the first step is getting people comfortable talking about them. We hope this partnership and our new, engaging ?edu-tainment? period and tampon content will encourage more people to laugh, talk and learn about them.? Period education is not new to Tampax. In 1941, with a strong female founder at the helm, Tampax established the company?s first educational department. The women educators became known as the ?Tampax Ladies,? traveling to colleges, doctors, and medical conventions to teach about menstruation and dispel myths and misconceptions about periods and tampons. Today, education is still a top priority for the brand and there is still much work to be done. The 2020 Tampax Period Education Survey1 revealed there is a significant knowledge gap when it comes to periods and tampons. This leads to misinformation, miseducation and missed opportunities that can limit a person?s potential. Some of the key findings include: Virtually no one (94% of adults) knows how many days the average menstrual cycle lasts 77% of adults believe that a tampon can get lost inside a woman?s body More than half of women (62%) can?t locate a vagina on a diagram 13% of adults admit to not knowing anything about tampons Nearly 1 in 10 adults (7%) think that a tampon can take a woman?s virginity ?When I started working with Tampax,? shared Amy Schumer, ?it made my heart hurt to hear about the discomfort people are putting up with because they don?t understand periods or even how to use a tampon properly, and I want to do everything I can to change that. My hope is that through this partnership, we?ll educate ourselves and each other and take the senseless shame out of getting your period.? Schumer is featured in a series of comedic videos, directed by Kathy Fusco of Hungryman, that are aimed at teaching people about their periods and tampons. Schumer is joined in this campaign by medical expert Dr. Melisa Holmes, OB/GYN and co-founder of Girlology, a leading health education community, to answer burning questions people have about their bodies, periods and tampons. The campaign will be brought to life across TV, video, digital and social media, including Snapchat, with a custom Lens that lets people put themselves in a Tampax tampon costume designed by small business owner, Claire Renaud of Costume Gallery, N.H. Tampax?s commitment to people with periods extends beyond education and superior period protection. Tampax has a history of giving and, over the last year, has donated more than 8 million tampons to people in need through partners including Matthew 25 Ministries, Feeding America and Good Foundation. Additionally, Tampax joined Procter & Gamble?s family of brands committing $5 million to the #TakeOnRace Fund for organizations striving for equality and justice like UNCF, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Color of Change and YWCA USA, while also using their social platform to elevate melanated voices. Furthermore, as a continuation of the brand?s mission, Tampax has partnered with Girlology to create the Tampax & Girlology Period Foundation to create access to medically accurate menstrual health education for young people in communities in need. With this powerful coalition, Tampax will make period conversations as normal as periods ? removing the stigma around periods and tampons so people can laugh about them, learn about them and have a more comfortable period experience.

Damit treibt das Unternehmen das Engagement zum Umwelt- und Klimaschutz auf globaler Basis weiter voran. Vor dem Hintergrund, dass das kommende Jahrzehnt ein entscheidendes Zeitfenster fﾃδεつεδづつｼr wissenschaftsbasierte Fortschritte zur Eindﾃδεつεδづつ､mmung des Klimawandels darstellt, verpflichtet sich P&G, Treibhausgasemissionen um 50% zu reduzieren und ﾃδεつεδづつｼber die bestehenden Ziele hinaus das Engagement zusﾃδεつεδづつ､tzlich in natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Klimaschutzlﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen zu forcieren, um Emissionen in den nﾃδεつεδづつ､chsten 10 Jahren zu kompensieren und die Geschﾃδεつεδづつ､ftsaktivitﾃδεつεδづつ､ten bis 2030 insgesamt CO2-neutral zu gestalten. Basierend auf aktuellen Schﾃδεつεδづつ､tzungen wird P&G dazu im Zeitraum von 2020 bis 2030 circa 30 Millionen Tonnen CO2 ausgleichen. Prioritﾃδεつεδづつ､t liegt dabei weiterhin auf der Reduzierung von Emissionen. Klares Ziel bleibt es, die Treibhausgasemissionen bis 2030 um 50% zu reduzieren. Mit der vollstﾃδεつεδづつ､ndigen Umstellung auf ﾃδεつεδづつ北ostrom aus erneuerbaren Quellen sieht sich P&G auf einem guten Weg, seine Verpflichtungen fﾃδεつεδづつｼr 2030 zu erfﾃδεつεδづつｼllen. Darﾃδεつεδづつｼberhinaus wird P&G zusﾃδεつεδづつ､tzliche Wind-, Solar- und Geothermieprojekte verfolgen, um die Umstellung auf ﾃδεつεδづつ北ostrom weiter zu beschleunigen. Diese Anstrengungen stehen im Einklang mit wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen aus der Klimaforschung und werden ﾃδεつεδづつｼber das Jahr 2030 hinaus fortgesetzt. P&G will damit dazu beitragen, den globalen Temperaturanstieg einzudﾃδεつεδづつ､mmen. Da sich basierend auf den heutigen Technologien bis 2030 nicht alle Emissionen vermeiden lassen, kﾃδεつεδづつｼndigte P&G an, in den nﾃδεつεδづつ､chsten 10 Jahre in natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Klimaschutzlﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen zu investieren, um Fortschritte zu machen und positive Effekte zu beschleunigen. Entscheidendes Zeitfenster fﾃδεつεδづつｼr Verﾃδεつεδづつ､nderung Jﾃδεつεδづつｼngste wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse machen deutlich, dass die Welt hinter den erforderlichen Reduzierungen der Treibhausgasemissionen zurﾃδεつεδづつｼckbleibt. Das nﾃδεつεδづつ､chste Jahrzehnt stellt daher ein kritisches Zeitfenster dar, um Emissionen zu reduzieren und den Temperaturanstieg auf 1,5 Grad Celsius zu begrenzen. Bis 2050 mﾃδεつεδづつｼssen die CO2-Emissionen gegen Null sinken. Verﾃδεつεδづつ､nderung muss daher jetzt stattfinden, ansonsten werden kommende Generationen durch die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels stﾃδεつεδづつ､rker gefﾃδεつεδづつ､hrdet und die Erreichung der globalen Ziele des Pariser Klimaschutzabkommens weiter erschwert. ?Der Klimawandel findet statt, und es muss jetzt gehandelt werden. Indem wir unseren CO2-Fuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdruck reduzieren und in natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Klimaschutzlﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen investieren, werden wir als Unternehmen in diesem Jahrzehnt CO2-neutral sein. Wir tragen damit dazu bei, besonders gefﾃδεつεδづつ､hrdete ﾃδεつεδづつ北osysteme und Lebensrﾃδεつεδづつ､ume fﾃδεつεδづつｼr kommende Generationen auf der ganzen Welt zu schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen?, so David Taylor, Chairman und CEO von P&G. Natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Klimaschutzlﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen: ?Die Natur kann bis zu einem Drittel des Klimawandels ausgleichen?. P&G wird mit Conservation International und dem World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) eine Vielzahl von Projekten zum Schutz, zur Verbesserung und zur Wiederherstellung gefﾃδεつεδづつ､hrdeter ﾃδεつεδづつ北osysteme wie Wﾃδεつεδづつ､lder, Feuchtgebiete, Grasland und Torfgebiete gemeinsam identifizieren und diese finanzieren. Neben der CO2-Perspektive haben natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Klimaschutzlﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen das Potenzial, sinnvolle ﾃδεつεδづつｶkologische und sozioﾃδεつεδづつｶkonomische Nebeneffekte im Naturschutz sowie mit Blick auf die Lebensgrundlagen in den betreffenden Regionen zu erzielen. Auch hier wird P&G Fortschritte messen und transparent machen. In diesem Zusammenhang entwickelt P&G derzeit eine detaillierte globale Projektﾃδεつεδづつｼbersicht. Zu den bereits identifizierten Projekten gehﾃδεつεδづつｶren: - Wiederherstellung des Regenwalds an der Ostkﾃδεつεδづつｼste Brasiliens zusammen mit dem WWF ? Wiederaufforstungsplﾃδεつεδづつ､ne mit bedeutenden Auswirkungen auf die biologische Vielfalt, Wasser und andere Umweltaspekte fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die die ﾃδεつεδづつｶrtlichen Gemeinschaften einschlieﾃδεつεδづつ殕ich der Ernﾃδεつεδづつ､hrungssicherheit. - Evergreen Alliance mit der Arbor Day Foundation ? Die Allianz bringt Unternehmen, Gemeinden und Bﾃδεつεδづつｼrger zusammen, um Maﾃδεつεδづつ殤ahmen zur Erhaltung vom Klimawandel betroffener Lebensgrundlagen zu ergreifen und Waldgebiete zu schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen ? etwa durch das Anpflanzen von Bﾃδεつεδづつ､umen zur Wiederherstellung durch Waldbrﾃδεつεδづつ､nde verwﾃδεつεδづつｼsteter Gebiete in Nordkalifornien oder zur Aufwertung von Wﾃδεつεδづつ､ldern. Konkret werden in Deutschland im Jahr 2021 insgesamt 25.000 Bﾃδεつεδづつ､ume neu angepflanzt; dabei arbeitet P&G mit dem Arbor Day Partner ?Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald, Landesverband Sachsen? zusammen. Im Fokus der Zusammenarbeit stehen kommunale Waldflﾃδεつεδづつ､chen im Landkreis Nordsachsen. Besonders in dieser Region Sachsens wurden viele Waldflﾃδεつεδづつ､chen in den letzten zwei Jahren durch Sturm, Dﾃδεつεδづつｼrre und Kﾃδεつεδづつ､ferbefall in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die Etablierung von klima- sowie standortangepassten Zukunftswﾃδεつεδづつ､ldern ist das gemeinsame Projekt von groﾃδεつεδづつ歹r Bedeutung. - Philippinisches Palawan-Schutzprojekt mit Conservation International ? Schutz, Verbesserung und Wiederherstellung der Mangrovenwﾃδεつεδづつ､lder und gefﾃδεつεδづつ､hrdeter ﾃδεつεδづつ北osysteme in Palawan. Palawan ist weltweit das viertgrﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ殳e, nicht zu ersetzende Gebiet fﾃδεつεδづつｼr einzigartige und bedrohte Wildtiere. ?Die Natur muss ein zentraler Bestandteil jeder Strategie zur Bekﾃδεつεδづつ､mpfung der Klimakrise sein?, sagte Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO von Conservation International. ?Die Forschung zeigt, dass wir unsere Klimaziele nicht erreichen kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen, wenn wir fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die CO2-Bilanz wertvolle ﾃδεつεδづつ北osysteme nicht schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen, wiederherstellen und pflegen. Diese Anstrengungen kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen ein Drittel der innerhalb des nﾃδεつεδづつ､chsten Jahrzehnts erforderlichen Emissionsreduktionen ausmachen. Sie sind wichtig, um die Lebensgrundlagen von Gemeinschaften, die in besonderem Maﾃδεつεδづつ歹 vom Klimawandel betroffen sind, zu unterstﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen. Wir freuen uns ﾃδεつεδづつｼber die Zusammenarbeit mit Procter & Gamble zum Schutz der Natur ? die damit verbundenen Investition sind ein Gewinn fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die Menschen und fﾃδεつεδづつｼr unseren Planeten?. ?Wir arbeiten bereits seit ﾃδεつεδづつｼber einem Jahrzehnt mit P&G zusammen, um Klimaschutz voranzutreiben und die Wﾃδεつεδづつ､lder zu schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen. Der groﾃδεつεδづつ歹 Umfang der Geschﾃδεつεδづつ､ftstﾃδεつεδづつ､tigkeit macht es mﾃδεつεδづつｶglich, Ergebnisse in einer Grﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ歹nordnung zu erzielen, die von entscheidender Bedeutung sind?, sagte Carter Roberts, US-Prﾃδεつεδづつ､sident und CEO des WWF. ?Wichtig ist, dass sich dieser Fortschritt nicht auf den eigenen Unternehmensfuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdruck beschrﾃδεつεδづつ､nkt. P&G war sehr frﾃδεつεδづつｼh ein wichtiger Partner in der Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, die dazu beigetragen hat, die Beschaffung von ﾃδεつεδづつ北ostrom durch Unternehmen in den USA auszuweiten. Die heutige Ankﾃδεつεδづつｼndigung stellt einen weiteren Meilenstein dar, indem sie den Fokus auf die Rolle legt, die die Erhaltung der Natur spielen kann ? nicht nur bei der Absorption von Emissionen, sondern auch mit Blick auf Dienstleistungen und Ressourcen, die das Leben auf der Erde erhalten. Wir freuen uns auf die Zusammenarbeit mit P&G, um die neuen Ziele im nﾃδεつεδづつ､chsten Jahrzehnt zu erreichen?. P&G-Marken ﾃδεつεδづつｼbernehmen eine Vorreiterrolle bei der Reduzierung des CO2-Fuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdrucks und bei klimafreundlichem Verhalten Seit mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten setzt sich P&G dafﾃδεつεδづつｼr ein, die ﾃδεつεδづつ北obilanz seiner Produkte auf wissenschaftlicher Basis zu optimieren und die Emissionen der Lieferketten sowie die Verwendung der Produkte durch die Verbraucher (Scope-3-Emissionen) besser zu ermitteln. Bis zu 85% der Scope-3-Emissionen von P&G entstehen bei der Verwendung der Produkte. P&G erreicht mit seinen Marken tﾃδεつεδづつ､glich fﾃδεつεδづつｼnf Milliarden Menschen, und mit dieser Grﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ歹nordnung geht die Verantwortung einher, den Verbrauchern die Mﾃδεつεδづつｶglichkeit zu geben, ihren CO2-Fuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdruck zu reduzieren und Energie, Wasser und natﾃδεつεδづつｼrliche Ressourcen einzusparen. - Mehr als 60% des ﾃδεつεδづつｶkologischen Fuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdrucks eines Waschmittels resultieren aus der Verwendung und dabei grﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ殳enteils aus der fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die Erwﾃδεつεδづつ､rmung des Wassers nﾃδεつεδづつｶtigen Energie. Ariel und Lenor haben daher Waschmittel mit hoher Effizienz beim Waschen bei niedrigen Temperaturen entwickelt und motivieren so zum Waschen bei niedrigen Temperaturen. Ziel ist es, dass zukﾃδεつεδづつｼnftig 70% der Waschladungen bei niedrigen Temperaturen und damit energiesparend durchgefﾃδεつεδづつｼhrt werden. Internen Schﾃδεつεδづつ､tzungen zufolge konnten so seit 2015 rund 15 Millionen Tonnen CO2 eingespart werden. - Das Handgeschirrspﾃδεつεδづつｼlmittel Fairy ist konzentrierter als herkﾃδεつεδづつｶmmliche Spﾃδεつεδづつｼlmittel. Das bedeutet, dass jeder Tropfen mehr Leistung bietet und so geringeren Energie- und Wasserverbrauch ermﾃδεつεδづつｶglicht. Durch die ﾃδεつεδづつｼberlegene Fettlﾃδεつεδづつｶsekraft erlaubt Fairy den Verbrauchern, Geschirr bei niedrigeren Temperaturen zu spﾃδεつεδづつｼlen. Allein durch die Reduzierung der Wassertemperatur von 50 Grad Celsius auf 30 Grad Celsius, kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen Energie gespart und der CO2-Fuﾃδεつεδづつ歛bdruck um die Hﾃδεつεδづつ､lfte reduziert werden. ?Unsere Fﾃδεつεδづつｼhrungsrolle besteht darin, eine emissionsﾃδεつεδづつ､rmere Wirtschaft zu ermﾃδεつεδづつｶglichen und einen Lebensstil, der Klima und Umwelt schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzt und dabei fﾃδεつεδづつｼr alle erschwinglich und mﾃδεつεδづつｶglich ist?, sagte Virginie Helias, Chief Sustainability Officer bei P&G. ?Es liegt in unserer Verantwortung, gefﾃδεつεδづつ､hrdete CO2-Reserven zu schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen und in Lﾃδεつεδづつｶsungen zu investieren, die unseren Planeten regenerieren. Die Verbraucher wollen ebenfalls mehr tun, um den Klimawandel zu bekﾃδεつεδづつ､mpfen. Als Unternehmen erreichen wir mit unseren Marken rund 5 Milliarden Menschen.

Voortbouwend op het succes van de afgelopen 10 jaar samenwerking en de gedeelde waarden ten aanzien van het verbeteren van het leven en het creﾃδεつεδづつｫren van een betere wereld, verbinden P&G en het IOC zich tot een uniek, publieksgedreven samenwerkingsverband om belangrijke vooruitgang te boeken op belangrijke gebieden ? gelijkheid en inclusie, ecologische duurzaamheid en maatschappelijke impact ? tot en met Los Angeles 2028. Voor het eerst heeft P&G ook de wereldwijde marketingrechten verworven voor het Internationaal Paralympisch Comitﾃδεつεδづつｩ (IPC) en de Paralympische Spelen in deze langlopende samenwerkingsovereenkomst met het IOC/IPC, waarbij het IOC toezicht houdt op de commerciﾃδεつεδづつｫle programma?s van het IPC en de Paralympische Spelen. ?Als TOP Partner van het IOC gedurende de afgelopen 10 jaar, zijn we enorm trots op het werk dat we samen hebben verricht,? aldus Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer van P&G. ?Met het volgende decennium voor de deur, realiseren we ons de mogelijkheden en de verantwoordelijkheid die sponsoring van de Olympische Spelen ons biedt om een bredere impact te maken. In de geest van de Olympische beweging, gebruiken we ons samenwerkingsverband om positieve veranderingen in de wereld teweeg te brengen op het gebied van gelijkheid en inclusie, ecologische duurzaamheid en maatschappelijke impact. We zullen elk van de volgende vier Spelen gebruiken als mijlpaal om de voortgang te meten en een betekenisvolle erfenis achter te laten.? Thomas Bach, President van het IOC, stelt: ?Procter & Gamble heeft zich een ware partner van het IOC betoond, evenals een krachtige medestander bij de ondersteuning van de idealen van de Olympische beweging. Met nog een jaar te gaan tot de Olympische Spelen van 2020 in Tokio, verheugt het ons bekend te maken dat we ?samen sterker? zullen staan met P&G tot 2028. Met het oog op de toekomst geven we prioriteit aan duidelijke, doelgerichte initiatieven die de visie van het IOC ondersteunen om te bouwen aan een betere wereld door middel van sport.? Als wereldwijde partner zal P&G de Olympische en Paralympische Spelen van 2020 in Tokio steunen, evenals de Olympische en Paralympische Winterspelen van 2020 in Peking, de Olympische en Paralympische Spelen van 2024 in Parijs, de Olympische en Paralympische Winterspelen van 2026 in Milaan-Cortina en de Olympische en Paralympische Spelen van 2028 in Los Angeles. Athletes for Good-fonds In lijn met de missie van het IOC om atleten te ondersteunen en hen het middelpunt van de Olympische beweging te maken, heeft het bedrijf als onderdeel van de volgende fase van de samenwerking van P&G met de Olympische en Paralympische beweging, het Athletes for Good-fonds opgezet ? een gezamenlijk initiatief van P&G, het IOC en het IPC voor het verstrekken van financiﾃδεつεδづつｫle bijdragen aan doelen die door Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten worden ondersteund om belangrijk werk te verrichten in overeenstemming met gedeelde maatschappelijke kernwaarden. Het Athletes for Good-fonds kent in de loop van het komende jaar in totaal 52 bijdragen toe via een aanvraagprocedure op het Athlete365-platform van het IOC ? ﾃδεつεδづつｩﾃδεつεδづつｩn voor elke week tot aan de openingsceremonie van de Olympische Spelen van 2020 in Tokio. Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten die samenwerken met organisaties die een bijdrage leveren aan hun gemeenschap op het gebied van maatschappelijke impact (COVID-19-hulp), gelijkheid en inclusie, en ecologische duurzaamheid, kunnen een bijdrage aanvragen. The Measure of Greatness Met nog precies een jaar te gaan tot de Olympische Spelen van 2020 in Tokio, nu de atleten voor een verlengde aanloop naar de Spelen staan, is P&G alle bestaande samenwerkingsverbanden met atleten nagekomen en vele ervan zijn verlengd tot 2021. Door middel van een videoserie met de titel The Measure of Greatness vestigt P&G tevens de aandacht op het verhaal van Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten van over de hele wereld die in 2020 zinvolle actie hebben ondernomen om hun gemeenschap te steunen. Pritchard vervolgt: ?Hoewel de wereld om ons heen de afgelopen maanden is veranderd, is ons doel als sponsor van de Olympische Spelen gelijk gebleven. We hebben altijd het belang onderkend van het traject dat atleten afleggen om hun Olympische dromen te realiseren en de vele mensen erkend die hen daarbij ondersteunen. Als onderdeel van dit nieuwe traject op weg naar Tokio, weten we dat dit tijdstip, met nog precies een jaar te gaan, een nieuwe betekenis krijgt voor atleten, hun families en fans. We blijven standvastig in onze steun aan atleten en we voelen ons vereerd om het verhaal onder de aandacht te brengen van uitzonderlijke Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten die in 2020 actie hebben ondernomen om hun gemeenschap te ondersteunen ? niet door hun atletische prestaties, maar door hun medeleven, hun menselijkheid en hun liefde.? In The Measure of Greatness worden Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten voor het voetlicht gebracht die hebben laten zien wat het betekent om een bron van inspiratie te zijn, op en buiten het speelveld. De film vertelt de inspirerende verhalen van atleten die dit moment hebben aangegrepen om zich op een andere manier in te zetten voor anderen. Van het strijden in de medische frontlinie tegen de COVID-19-pandemie, tot het verheffen van hun stem voor raciale gelijkheid en het aanwenden van hun middelen om medische apparatuur en voedsel te krijgen waar deze het hardst nodig zijn ? deze atleten staan symbool voor de manier waarop mensen liefdevol het voortouw kunnen nemen in deze uitdagende tijden. The Measure of Greatness is een digitale film die de inspirerende verhalen verteld van de volgende Olympische en Paralympische atleten en aspirant-atleten: Kim Daybell, Groot-Brittanniﾃδεつεδづつｫ, paralympisch tafeltennis: Kim stond op het punt om fulltime te gaan trainen om zich voor te bereiden op Tokio, maar keerde in plaats daarvan terug naar zijn fulltime baan als medische SHO (senior house officer) om COVID-19-patiﾃδεつεδづつｫnten te begeleiden in een Londens ziekenhuis. Hij werkt elke week 40-60 uur in het ziekenhuis, terwijl hij mentaal en fysiek fit blijft voor zijn traject op weg naar Tokio 2020. Simone Manuel, Verenigde Staten, zwemmen: Als eerste zwarte vrouw die een individuele medaille won in het Olympische zwemmen, is Simone een uitgesproken pleitbezorger van het aan de kaak stellen van raciale stereotypen in het wedstrijdzwemmen. Ze heeft haar platform consequent gebruikt om haar volgers te leren hoe ze actief antiracistisch kunnen zijn, om de stem van de zwarte bevolking te versterken en iedereen aan te moedigen om in het groot te denken en zich niet te laten kluisteren door stereotypen. Sinds het begin van de COVID-19-uitbraak heeft Simone haar platform ook gebruikt om organisaties te ondersteunen die broodnodige maaltijden verschaffen aan mensen in onzekere voedselomstandigheden. Kento Momota, Japan, badminton: Momota-san doneerde 10 procent van het prijzengeld van zijn toernooien in 2019 (USD 50.000) aan de Tokyo Medical Association ter ondersteuning van de hulpverlening voor COVID-19 en droeg bij aan de schenking van 200.000 maskers aan studenten en medisch personeel in Japan. Hij heeft ook tijd besteed aan het begeleiden van jeugdbadmintonspelers en biedt zodoende aanmoediging en motivatie in deze tijd waarin ze zich bezig moeten houden met andere zaken dan sport. Pamphinette (Pam) Buisa, Canada, rugby: Pam was mede-organisator van een vredesbijeenkomst voor Black Lives in Victoria, Canada, en is een prominente stem in de Canadese atletische gemeenschap die anderen aanmoedigt om deel te nemen aan antiracistische activiteiten en rechtvaardige verzoening. Daarnaast heeft Pam haar krachten gebundeld met verschillende vrouwen in haar gemeenschap om een COVID-19-noodfonds op te richten en geld in te zamelen voor mensen in nood op Vancouver Island. ?Hoewel het uitstel van de Olympische Spelen voor mij een teleurstelling was, realiseerde ik me meteen dat er belangrijkere dingen te doen waren om onze gemeenschap, ons land en onze wereld te helpen. Ik wist dat ik een belangrijke kans had om mijn stem en mijn middelen te gebruiken om mijn gemeenschap in deze ongekende tijd ondersteuning te bieden,? aldus Simone Manuel. ?Bovendien was het ongelooflijk om getuige en deelgenoot te zijn van een keerpunt in de geschiedenis waarin we met elkaar strijden voor gelijkheid voor iedereen.? The Measure of Greatness is te zien op: https://youtu.be/ZciNNbgXSIA In het kader van het samenwerkingsverband zet P&G zijn expertise en baanbrekende ideeﾃδεつεδづつｫn in om het IOC te helpen bij het uitbreiden, versnellen en innoveren van de digitale capaciteiten, producten en bedrijfsmiddelen van het IOC. Hiermee ondersteunt het bedrijf de strategie van het IOC om mensen bij de Olympische beweging te betrekken en ook op lange termijn relevant te blijven, zowel tijdens de Spelen als in de tussenliggende periodes. Jiri Kejval, Marketing Commission Chair van het IOC, stelt: ?Deze verlenging van onze overeenkomst met P&G is opnieuw een duidelijk teken van de duurzame aantrekkingskracht van het Worldwide Olympic Partner-programma, evenals van de toewijding waarmee onze partners de Olympische waarden wereldwijd ondersteunen en promoten. Het IOC gebruikt 90 procent van de inkomsten die de organisatie genereert voor het ondersteunen van sport en atleten, het hele jaar door.?

Now, thanks to Gillette Venus and the launch of their NEW Skinclusive Summer Line by Venus, women everywhere can enjoy the sensations of summer virtually in Animal Crossing with characters that represent the diversity of their skin in real life. It is important to ensure all women and all skin are represented and celebrated. Everywhere. That?s why Venus partnered with digital designer, Nicole Cuddihy, to co-create new avatar designs within Animal Crossing that serve as the largest offering of skin-inclusive designs to ever be available within the game. This collection is taking Animal Crossing from just a few representations of skin to 19 different skin types in 8 in-game skin tones, resulting in over 250 designs that include common skin realities like freckles, acne, hair, cellulite, scars and stretch marks, and more unique and under-represented skin like vitiligo, tattoos, psoriasis, and differently-abled bodies. The launch of the Summer Skinclusive Line by Venus is the newest activation of the Venus ?My Skin. My Way? campaign, which is the brand?s commitment to stand up for every woman?s right to feel comfortable and live freely in her own skin. But this summer, living comfortably and freely ? and even enjoying the sun and the beach ? has taken on a whole new meaning. Now, women around the world are expressing themselves and their individuality on Animal Crossing, which has quickly become the number one talked about game during quarantine and is most popular among women ages 19-24. By bringing more representation to Animal Crossing, Venus is enabling players to see and celebrate more of their natural identity in the world of gaming. ?In a world where there are so many explicit and implicit rules on how women should show or feel about their skin, skin-inclusivity and positive representation matters,? said Anthony van Dijk, Senior Brand Director of Venus North America. ?The purpose of our My Skin. My Way campaign is to ensure that we?re putting out responsible imagery that represents reality and celebrates all types of skin, while also spotlighting the diverse skin stories of women all around the world. With Animal Crossing, we saw a unique opportunity to meet women where they are this summer by providing new ways to make gaming a more inclusive space, while also enabling them to gather virtually, safely on a beach to celebrate summer and skin inclusivity.? On the inspiration and heartfelt purpose behind the designs, Cuddihy says, ?While momentum for diversity in design is building, there are many areas where progress feels slow. The fact that I could add scars and wrinkles to warriors or outlaws, but not characters in less combat-driven games felt discouraging. With these designs, I hope that all women in Animal Crossing can find comfort and representation in this carefully developed collection. I drew inspiration from those in my own life to ensure the designs I was creating accurately represented their skin stories in a way that feels real, celebratory and beautiful.? To celebrate the launch of the Skinclusive Summer Line by Venus and National Beach Day, Venus will host an Animal Crossing ?Skinclusive Summer Social? event on YouTube Live on Monday, August 31st.

WHAT: The Tide Loads of Hope Mobile Laundry Units have been deployed to support relief and recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Laura. The Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry vehicles will begin services in Lake Charles, Louisiana, providing free, full-service laundry to residents affected by the recent hurricane. Residents can bring clothes (up to two loads per household) to be washed, dried and folded free of charge. All washable clothing types will be accepted with the exception of heavy bedding. In partnership with Matthew 25: Ministries, P&G will also distribute free personal care kits with everyday essentials as well as cleaning products to meet basic hygiene and home care needs directly into the affected areas of those impacted by the disaster. In line with updated COVID-19 guidelines regarding operations, P&G and partner, Matthew 25: Ministries, have established new safety protocols and processes to allow for the distribution of free laundry supplies and services to those who have been impacted by the disaster, while keeping staff and beneficiaries at Tide Loads of Hope distribution and activation sites protected. Safety precautions include the deployment of both Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundromat units to allow for social distancing on-site, increased use of PPE, increased sanitation practices, signage instructions and non-contact registration. In addition, the team will adhere to all local health agency COVID-19 guidelines and ask individuals who are visiting the mobile laundry units to wear masks. WHY: Hurricane Laura devastated Louisiana as a Category 4 storm with wind gusts of 150 mph causing heavy storm surge as far inland as 30 miles in parts of the state. The storm damaged thousands of homes and left many without power or access to clean water. P&G has a history of giving back to the communities where we live and work, and we want to provide everyday essentials to those who need it most to help bring a sense of normalcy in this time of need. These services are free and available to people affected by the disaster and the volunteers who are helping to respond. WHERE: Starting on Tuesday, September 1, the team will collect laundry from 10 a.m. ? 3 p.m. CDT at the Walmart listed below or until daily capacity has been reached (two loads per household). The team will also be distributing personal care kits and cleaning supplies directly into the affected areas.

Since 2005, Tide has helped renew hope for more than 48,000 families across the country affected by natural disasters ? from tornadoes in Missouri to hurricanes in Texas and wildfires in California.

Mason Bell?s offer price is approximately 23.6% lower than the $138.77 closing price of P&G?s common stock on August 28, 2020, the last trading day prior to the date of the offer (August 31, 2020). Mason Bell previously conducted a mini-tender offer for 10,000 shares of the Company?s stock at the same significantly-below-market price. P&G is not associated in any way with Mason Bell LLC or its mini-tender offer. P&G does not endorse Mason Bell?s offer and again recommends shareholders do not tender their shares in response to this unsolicited mini-tender offer because the offer is at a price significantly below the current market price of P&G?s shares and is subject to numerous conditions. In addition, mini-tender offers, such as this one by Mason Bell, avoid many of the investor protections afforded to larger tender offers, including the filing of disclosure and other tender offer documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other procedures mandated by U.S. securities laws. The SEC has issued ?Tips for Investors? regarding mini-tender offers, noting that some bidders, in making the offers at below-market prices, are ?hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.? The SEC?s advisory may be found on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. Mason Bell has included a condition in the terms of its offer that permits it to terminate the offer if the price of P&G?s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange decreases below the $106.00 offer price before the offer expires. Unless Mason Bell waives this condition, P&G common stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. P&G urges common stockholders to obtain current market quotations for their shares of common stock, to consult their broker or financial advisor, and to exercise caution with respect to Mason Bell?s offer. P&G recommends that common stockholders who have not responded to Mason Bell?s offer take no action. P&G common stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw their shares by providing the written notice described in the Mason Bell offering documents prior to the expiration of the offer, currently scheduled for 8:00 p.m., New York City Time on October 13, 2020. P&G urges brokers, dealers and other market participants to review the SEC?s recommendations to broker-dealers in these circumstances, which can be found on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. P&G requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials relating to Mason Bell?s mini-tender offer.

Created in partnership with top medical professionals at the Cleveland Clinic and cleaning and disinfection experts from P&G Professional, the away-from-home division of Procter & Gamble, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA), Graduate Cares was designed to meet the standards of the industry?s most trusted experts and rethinks the end-to-end cleaning and guest interaction procedures. A recent survey from P&G Professional found that 70 percent of hotel guests have a more stringent definition of ?hotel cleanliness? since COVID-19 and more than 50 percent expect more thorough and frequent cleaning and transparency around what the hotel is doing to keep guests safe and rooms clean, including visible signs of cleaning and signage around the property. ?The health and safety of our guests has always been a priority for us at Graduate Hotels, and we have used the past few months to focus on how we can amplify this element of the experience to meet the current needs of travelers,? said Graduate Hotels President, David Rochefort. ?We?re honored to have teamed up with top experts in the medical, cleaning and hospitality industries to create Graduate Cares and offer guests and associates a best-in-class cleanliness program. As we continue to reopen our Graduate Hotels portfolio, we?re pleased to provide an experience that helps ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who walks in our doors.? Graduate Cares is in place at each of Graduate Hotels? 26 properties across the country, and new protocols call for increased safety measures at guest check in and check out, guest rooms to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized with hospital-grade levels of cleanliness with special attention paid to: doors and doorknobs, lighting controls, remote controls, and other high touch surfaces in guest rooms and common areas. In addition, each property will utilize visible signage to share cleaning protocols and products used, including in guest rooms after cleaning, so guests can be confident the spaces are clean, disinfected, and protected. Strict protocols have also been established for the safety of all employees, both those who interact with guests and those who don?t. All associates will participate in advanced health awareness training, daily wellness checks, and increased and mandatory handwashing procedures, and will be required to wear gloves, face masks and shields. ?Throughout our relationship with Graduate Hotels, we?ve seen that cleanliness and safety are at the core of their guest experience and we?re proud to support their hotels as they welcome students, alumni and guests back to their locations across the nation,? said Paul Edmondson, Vice President North America, P&G Professional. ?As people resume their travels, it is more important than ever that hotels achieve and maintain a high level of cleanliness and disinfection. P&G Professional has top brands like Dawn Professional, Safeguard, Spic and Span, and Comet to help ensure spaces are cleaned, disinfected and protected for Graduate Hotels employees and guests as they reach these new standards of clean.?

Last season, Patrick and Troy joined Head & Shoulders in a heated debate about what is more critical for success ? a high-powered offense or a strong defense ? whether they?re playing the game on the field or fighting flakes in the shower. This year, the dynamic duo is back and they?re taking it up to 100 on behalf of the brand?s new Take It Up To 100 Campaign. Patrick and Troy have accomplished a lot this last year, with Patrick taking his play (and flake-free hair) to 100 as the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, while legendary veteran safety Troy got to 100 by getting inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In the brand?s latest campaign, Patrick and Troy go to absurd lengths to try to one up each other when it comes to taking it up to 100, whether it's being 100% invested on the field, answering 100% of mom?s phone calls, catching 100% of kids who fall off their bikes, or having 100% dandruff protection thanks to Head & Shoulders. ?I?ve always taken it up to 100 with everything in my life ? from football to my grades in school to my 100% flake-free hair and scalp,? shares Patrick. Troy agrees and adds that ?the campaign has such a great message to encourage everyone to always give everything 100% no matter what.? Head & Shoulders? 100% dandruff protection gives you great hair, and the Patrick and Troy-like confidence to take everything up to 100. To find out how else Patrick and Troy are taking it up to 100 this season, watch this year?s commercial and stay tuned on Head & Shoulders? Twitter (@HeadShoulders) to see how the campaign unfolds. About Head & Shoulders With over 50 years of trailblazing innovation on scalp care, Head & Shoulders has established itself as the leader in dandruff protection and is the world?s #1 shampoo, used by 1.3 billion people across 140 countries.

The company?s longstanding partnership with P&G Professional, the away-from-home division of Procter & Gamble, supports Extended Stay America?s STAY Confident initiative designed to keep its hotels healthy, safe and comfortable for guests and staff. The comprehensive program utilizes trusted brands like Spic and Span, Comet and Mr. Clean Professional to clean and disinfect all guest rooms and common spaces, with increased attention to high touch and heavily trafficked areas throughout each hotel. A recent survey from P&G Professional found that 70 percent of hotel guests have a more stringent definition of ?hotel cleanliness? since COVID-19 and 57 percent expect more thorough and frequent cleaning and transparency around what the hotel is doing to keep guests safe and rooms clean, both in person and on the company website. The same survey revealed that 70 percent of hotel guests would be more likely to pick a hotel room if they knew the hotel was using a manufacturer or brand of cleaning products they personally knew or trusted. ?Providing a safe, healthy and comfortable place to stay with friendly welcoming staff is foundational to our guest experience, and we?ve long understood that our guests like to see trusted cleaning products in use at our properties,? said Mike Kuenne, Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer of Extended Stay America. ?Extended Stay America has been proudly partnered with P&G Professional for many years and their recognizable brands are an important part of ensuring our guests feel confident that we?re focused on making their stays safe and comfortable.? Through the STAY Confident program, expanded cleaning and safety measures have been adopted for vans, front desk areas, lobbies, elevators, guest rooms, laundry and vending machines, and other highly touched and trafficked areas in every Extended Stay America location. As part of its commitment to health, spaces are cleaned and disinfected with Spic and Span, Comet and Mr. Clean Professional, employees and guests are required to wear masks in all public areas, social distancing measures are in place, and specialized training is provided for all Extended Stay America teams. Additionally, all rooms are inspected and approved by management prior to guest check-in as part of a 10-point room cleaning process. ?Throughout our nearly decade-long partnership with Extended Stay America, we?ve recognized the critical importance they place on cleanliness and guest health,? said Paul Edmondson, Vice President North America, P&G Professional. ?While businesspeople and vacationers alike resume their travels, it is more important than ever that hotels maintain the highest levels of cleanliness for their guests and staff, and the STAY Confident initiative with P&G Professional products ensures that all Extended Stay America locations can achieve these standards of clean.?

In a recent survey conducted by P&G Professional, more than one third of respondents (37 percent) are extremely concerned about COVID-19, and a majority indicated that they would patronize a business if they know and trust the cleaning brands used by that business (70 percent).

As part of Secret?s pledge to donate an additional $1 million in support of equality programs, the brand is taking immediate action in partnership with YWCA USA to establish a ?Secret Missions? fund that will provide direct assistance to women. These ?Secret Missions? will focus on childcare, career development and other key areas that make a difference in the lives of women and their families. ?The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and even further increased inequalities in opportunities and income for multicultural women,? said Freddy Bharucha, Senior Vice President, North America & Global Personal Care, Procter & Gamble. ?Secret is proud to step up, in partnership with the YWCA, to provide assistance and opportunities to the women who need it the most. Together, we will #RaiseItUp for women everywhere.? According to McKinsey & Company?s Women in the Workplace 2020 study, women?especially Black women and women of color?are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis,2 stalling their careers and jeopardizing their financial security. In fact, the Department of Labor stated that out of the 700,000 jobs that were eliminated in the first wave of pandemic layoffs, nearly 60 percent were held by women.3 Similarly, one in three mothers has considered leaving the workforce or downshifting her career since the pandemic, with household responsibilities, childcare and home-schooling listed as top contributing factors. ?The 2020 pandemic has exacerbated many of the things women already face, and they have been shouldering the weight of the challenges brought on this year,? said Sara Saunders, Senior Brand Director, Secret & Gillette. ?Through our #RaiseItUp initiative, we aim to not only celebrate the strength and resilience of women but also take meaningful action to support them in the areas of their life that mean the most.? ?COVID-19 has eroded many positive gains towards closing gender gaps and has placed added impediments for women to be sources of significant global growth,? said Alejandra Y. Castillo, CEO, YWCA USA. ?In order to mitigate those losses, it is imperative now more than ever that brand and organizations like Secret and YWCA USA unite to work to advance equality for all women through initiatives like #RaiseItUp. This partnership will help us continue to deliver programming, services, and other resources that support our mission to eliminate racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.? #RaiseItUp Campaign Details Women are the coaches, players, trainers and fans in everyday life. From morning to night, they run non-stop. They are accepting the challenges thrown at them in 2020, and Secret is calling on women everywhere to share a photo on social media of what it means to them to #RaiseItUp. Notable women, including WNBA stars Swin Cash and A?Ja Wilson, helped kick off a social media campaign, sharing their own personal #RaiseItUp images and inviting women to share how they ?raise it up? ? at home, at work, for their families and, most importantly, for themselves.

Secret x WNBA Finals TV Commercial Developed internally by P&G in-house creative team, Secret also debuted a new television commercial during the WNBA finals on Sunday, Oct. 4. The :60 second spot features the work of two dynamic, creative Black women: an original poem by poet, author and activist, Jasmine Mans, and it was directed by Chassidy Jade, who also works to give opportunities to high school graduates interested in film, specifically young Black women and women of color. Cameos include some of the WNBA?s biggest stars, including newly minted Most Valuable Player (MVP) A?Ja Wilson and WNBA ?Wubble Moms? Phoenix Mercury?s Bria Hartley and Candice Dupree of the Indiana Fever. No Sweat Here (:60) - The spot highlights the challenges women have faced as a result of COVID-19. Provocative and bold, Jasmine?s work embodies what it means to elevate women?s voices, especially those of Black and Latinx women. Through her poetry in Secret?s new spot, Mans tells a story that unites all women in their strength. About Secret Secret was the first antiperspirant brand designed specifically for women, and for the past 60 years, Secret has been on the forefront of women?s lives, leading with innovation designed to provide superior odor and wetness protection. Through the years, the brand has proudly supported women?s advancement and equality through its campaigns and communications. Its latest campaign, ?All Strength, No Sweat,? is a continuation of this commitment to women, celebrating those who boldly challenge the status quo, push through barriers and stand up for what they believe in, without ?sweating? the obstacles that may come their way. Secret challenges women everywhere to be all strength, no sweat.

Experts report that confidence is the best predictor of achievement in both mathematics and English, is related to both cognitive and self-belief measures, and is among the best-known predictors of success.1 As the first of many steps, Old Spice is partnering with film company Never Whisper Justice, producers of the just-released ?BLACK BOYS? film and creators of eLearning platform Frontlines of Justice. The purpose of Frontlines of Justice is to improve the learning outcomes for tens of thousands of underrepresented students nationwide. The Frontlines of Justice curriculum fosters personal development for students and professional development for educators, which builds on the racial, educational and social justice themes from the newly-released documentary ?BLACK BOYS.? Old Spice is partnering with Frontlines of Justice to extend their educational offerings to more students, and educators across the country. Executive produced by two-time Super Bowl champion and New Orleans Saints star Malcolm Jenkins, ?BLACK BOYS,? is now streaming on NBC Peacock. The film celebrates the full spectrum of humanity of Black men and boys in America while showcasing the social and emotional effects of racism and invites audiences to imagine a world in which Black boys experience true belonging and unlimited possibilities. ?While ?BLACK BOYS? powerfully shows racism?s emotional cost, the accompanying social impact campaign supported by Old Spice will extend the film?s influence to generate a conversation and inspire dialogue and tangible outcomes between students, teachers and administrators,? said Jenkins. ?We all have a responsibility to chart our children?s future and I?m proud to partner with Old Spice to foster educational environments that will allow all kids to thrive.? Old Spice, a long-time NFL partner, is working with NFL players and teams to amplify the educational programs and reach more communities. Old Spice will kick off support in October with Jenkins who will make surprise virtual school appearances and host a ?BLACK BOYS? screening in New Orleans. Old Spice will continue to promote Frontlines of Justice with NFL player appearances and screenings in cities across the country throughout the season. ?Students may be getting some ?virtual? fatigue, which is why we want to create meaningful engagement with their favorite NFL players,? said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice brand Vice President at Procter & Gamble. ?We?re excited to formalize partnerships and use our resources to enable success for the next generation.? Old Spice has long helped young men and boys? transition into young adulthood. This year, Old Spice partnered with the 2020 NFL Draft Class to donate $320,000 to the United Way on their behalf, and helped contribute to parent company P&G?s $5,000,000 Take on Race, which supports the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, YWCA Stand Against Racism, Courageous Conversations and United Negro College Fund.

In addition, Holders whose Securities are accepted will also receive accrued interest on such Securities. (2) Hypothetical Total Consideration for each series of Securities is based upon a hypothetical Reference Yield (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) determined as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on October 13, 2020 and assumes a Settlement Date of October 29, 2020. The Reference Yield used to determine actual consideration for the Securities is expected to be calculated on October 27, 2020. The information provided in the above table with respect to the Securities is for illustrative purposes only. The Company and the dealer managers for the tender offer make no representation with respect to the actual consideration that may be paid with respect to the Securities, and such amounts may be greater or less than those shown in the above table depending on the Reference Yield as of the Price Determination Date. The amounts of each series of Securities that are purchased will be determined in accordance with the acceptance priority levels specified in the table above (the ?Acceptance Priority Level?), with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 10 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level. The tender offer is being made upon and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated October 13, 2020 (the ?Offer to Purchase?), and the related Letter of Transmittal. The tender offer will expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of November 9, 2020, unless extended or terminated (the ?Expiration Time?). Tenders of Securities may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 26, 2020, but may not be withdrawn thereafter except where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. The prices to be paid for each series of Securities accepted for purchase will be determined at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the business day following the Early Tender Deadline (as it may be extended, the ?Price Determination Date?). The prices to be paid for the Securities will be calculated on the basis of the yield to the maturity date of the applicable reference security listed in the table above on the Price Determination Date. Holders of Securities that are validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 26, 2020 (unless extended, the ?Early Tender Deadline?) and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration, which includes the applicable early tender premium specified in the table above (the ?Early Tender Premium?). Holders of Securities who validly tender their Securities following the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time and whose Securities are accepted for purchase will only receive the applicable ?Tender Offer Consideration,? which is equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the applicable Early Tender Premium. Payments for Securities purchased will include accrued and unpaid interest from and including the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Securities up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date for such Securities accepted for purchase. If the tender offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, subject to the Maximum Tender Amount, Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Securities tendered following the Early Tender Deadline even if such Securities tendered following the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Securities tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline. Securities of a series may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would cause the Maximum Tender Amount to be exceeded. Furthermore, if the tender offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, holders who validly tender Securities following the Early Tender Deadline will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase. P&G?s obligation to accept for payment and to pay for the Securities validly tendered in the tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a financing condition and certain other general conditions described in the Offer to Purchase. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as the dealer managers for the tender offer.

This Adopt-A-Dog-Month,"CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Febreze is launching ?Say Up to Your Pup,? a call for dog owners everywhere to invite their furry friends up onto furniture for cuddles and stop worrying about odors that may get left behind. Smells from dogs can get trapped in the fibers of the most tough-to-clean fabrics, causing pawrents to say ?off? the couch, bed, and furniture, and miss out on snuggle time?but Febreze Fabric Refresher makes it easy to eliminate those malodors, leaving behind a light, clean scent. To get the word out, Febreze is partnering with Queer Eye star and pawrent Karamo and the world?s largest no-kill rescue and adoption organization, North Shore Animal League America. The goal is to help make the transition from shelters to homes a bit easier for everyone this Adopt-a-Dog Month. ?My dog Logan is so adorable, but I was always hesitant to let him next to me on my couch or in bed because of the smell he?d leave behind,? says Karamo. ?But with Febreze Fabric Refresher, living with a dog means still having a fresh-smelling home all the time. Now I say come on ?up? and give me all the cuddles!? Febreze Fabric Refresher can be used on fabrics weekly to eliminate odors as part of a regular cleaning routine and is easy to use: Simply turn the nozzle on, and spray in a sweeping motion to lightly mist the fabric in question, and then let it dry. It can be used on hard-to-wash fabrics like carpets, furniture, upholstery, bedding, throws or blankets, and not on fabrics that water spot, such as silk, suede, and leather. Karamo is also helping Febreze kick off a call-to-action on social media, to help raise donations to North Shore Animal League America. He?ll be sharing photos of his dog on Instagram and encouraging others to join in. For every in-feed photo or video on Instagram of a dog ?up? on a couch, bed, or furniture with the hashtag #SayUpWithFebreze, Febreze will donate $25 (up to $25,000 with a minimum donation of $20,000) to support North Shore Animal League America?s no-kill mission. Instagram profile must be set to public in order for hashtag use to be counted as a donation. ?It?s important that pet-parents create homes that are comfortable for everyone, where quality time can be shared,? says Joanne Yohannan, Senior Vice President of Operations at North Shore Animal League America. ?We are excited to partner with Febreze on ?Say Up to Your Pup?, since Febreze Fabric Refresher is one tool that helps pet parents worry less so they can confidently invite their dog ?up? for more cherished time together.? With Febreze Fabric Refresher, Saying Up to Your Pup never felt (or smelled) so good. Febreze Fabric Refresher is available at retailers nationwide and online starting at $4.49 in varieties such as Pet Odor Eliminator, Extra Strength, and Gain.

The partnership and lesson plan will be unveiled today, Global Handwashing Day, at CanvasCon Online, an annual conference for educators and edtech experts held virtually this year. ?As educators navigate a very different back-to-school season this year, we want to help them feel prepared and provide them with resources that can help instill proper hygiene in their students such as appropriate handwashing,? said Tara Gunther, vice president of partnerships at Instructure. ?By putting hygiene-focused lesson content on Canvas, Safeguard can help schools across the country in a national effort to educate and protect families this fall and winter.? The handwashing education covers what germs are and emphasizes how and why we wash our hands through a series of lesson plans, a digital activity book and videos. The Safeguard handwashing lesson plans will be available to download on the Canvas Commons platform, a shared repository of learning content for educators to use within Canvas. The lessons were co-created with Sourcebooks and elementary school teachers to ensure the content is both engaging and effective for students. With its micellar deep cleansing technology, Safeguard Hand Soap safely washes away kids? germs and leaves hands clean and hydrated. ""As a first grade teacher, I know that learning takes repetition and the earlier we can teach students proper handwashing techniques, the more likely children will adopt good hand hygiene as everyday habits,? said Fernanda Sandoval, first grade teacher and founder of One Happy Classroom. ?It's wonderful and incredibly helpful that Safeguard is creating lesson plans on handwashing that are engaging for students and accessible to all educators nationwide."" ?Young students need to be directly taught the importance of hand hygiene, to learn the correct way to wash their hands, and to be a part of the solution to slowing the spread of germs,? said Michelle Griffo, kindergarten teacher and founder of Apples and ABC's. ?I am so excited that Safeguard created lesson plans to focus on the importance of students washing their hands correctly.? The initiative with Canvas follows Safeguard?s $10 million donation in product and education resources to promote handwashing habits among kids and provide more underserved communities with free hygiene products through organizations including Save the Children and Americares. Safeguard is proud to promote hand hygiene education and provide schools with soap and sanitizer products that have been dermatologically endorsed by the Skin Health Alliance. ""Now more than ever, it?s important that people wash their hands, especially as the cold and flu season is quickly approaching,? Family physician Dr. Jen Caudle said. ?I?m proud to work with Safeguard to help bring educators and families alike safe and effective hand hygiene practices to school children.? To amplify the program and celebrate Global Handwashing Day, Safeguard is working with various notables and experts to participate in the second iteration of the #SafeguardSplash social media challenge. The social movement serves as an important reminder across generations of the importance of washing hands properly and often in an effort to safeguard loved ones. ?Safeguard continues to be a leader in hygiene education for the younger generation and we are proud to work with Canvas to reach students and teachers through an accessible platform along with providing underserved communities with the proper products to do so,? said Freddy Bharucha, Senior Vice President, North America & Global Personal Care, Procter & Gamble. ?This is a stressful time for many as young children return to school, which is why now -- and always -- we are dedicated to providing hand hygiene products that people can trust.?

And as we look to the future of our ?new normal?, it?s become apparent women will face a disproportionate negative impact in their daily lives and in sport. As noted by Canadian Women & Sport*: ?Huge revenue losses, deep cuts and a tight focus on ?core business? threaten initiatives dedicated to leveling the field for women. Marketers, media and investors may gravitate toward the ?safe bet? of men?s sport. And heightened competition for scarce resources?such as places to play and train?may leave more women and girls sitting on the bench.? While many men?s professional sports have continued to push forward defying all odds, women?s professional hockey has taken a back seat and is in jeopardy of losing all momentum. Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Deodorant believes equal sweat deserves an equal opportunity and is committing $1 million to the Professional Women?s Hockey Players Association (PWHPA), the largest corporate commitment ever made for professional women?s hockey in North America. This funding is integral to ensuring the sport?s top players are given an opportunity to play and are given a spotlight to advocate for a new and equitable professional women?s hockey league. ?As a brand committed to empowering and emboldening women, we can?t stand by and see gender equality unravel. Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ proudly stands with the PWHPA and its players to fight for a new professional league to ensure all players ? regardless of gender - are given the same chance and support to play,? says Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Senior Brand Director Lisa Reid. ?Hockey is Canada?s sport, and this issue is both symbolic and pervasive. Countless women are being told they don?t deserve the same opportunities as men; tackling professional hockey equity is our first, but not last, fight. The PWHPA and its players represent the top athletes in the sport who deserve to have the same opportunities as the men.? While these players shine on the Olympic stage, the years in between are very different. Until 2019, women?s professional hockey lacked adequate access to training facilities, equipment, ice time, salaries, support teams, marketing support and broadcast visibility. And last year, it got worse, with the shutdown of the Canadian Women?s Hockey League. This instigated the formation of the PWHPA and its first Dream Gap Tour. Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ was one of the first brands to step up then, as they are now, to bring this issue to the national stage. This year, 125 of the sport?s top players, including 38 Olympians like Marie-Philip Poulin, Natalie Spooner, Sarah Nurse, Kendall Coyne Schofield, Hilary Knight and Brianna Decker will take the ice in the Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Dream Gap Tour with teams in Toronto, Calgary, Montreal, Minnesota and New Hampshire. Through a series of six Showcase events across North America, for the first time ever, players will compete for cash prizes and the Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Cup. Events like these are critical to bring attention to the incredible talent of these athletes and the need for better infrastructure to support girls? and women?s hockey. The full player roster is now available on the PWHPA website. ?Thanks to brands like Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ, players are given access to the necessary training facilities and resources and opportunities to compete, that professional sport demands. And fans are given the chance to cheer on their favourite athletes and rally behind their home teams,? says PWHPA Operations Consultant Jayna Hefford. ?COVID-19 affected our positive momentum and threatened our upcoming season. We?re so thankful for Secret?s ongoing support of the PWHPA. The PWHPA is made up of the best hockey players in the world, the fans deserve a chance to watch these women play and our players deserve to be treated equitably. This is a pivotal moment to create real change in women?s professional sports.? More About the Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Dream Gap Tour: Who will take the ice during the Secretﾃδεつづδづつｮ Dream Gap Tour?

The Total Consideration payable for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase by P&G includes an early tender premium. In addition, holders whose Securities are accepted will also receive accrued interest on such Securities. The amounts of each series of Securities that will be accepted for purchase were determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels specified in the table above, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 10 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level. The maximum aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued interest, that P&G will pay in the tender offer is an amount that is sufficient to allow P&G to purchase the entire tendered principal amounts of the Securities, as of the Early Tender Deadline (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), in Acceptance Priority Levels 1 through 10 specified in the table above. Based on the pricing set forth above, this amount is $1,984,030,579.09. The prices to be paid for the Securities were calculated on the basis of the yield, listed in the table above, to the applicable maturity date of the applicable reference security, in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase. Holders of the Securities that were validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration specified in the table above. The tender offer will expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of November 9, 2020, unless extended or terminated. However, because the tender offer was fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, holders who validly tender Securities following that time will not have any of their Securities accepted for purchase. Securities not accepted for purchase will be promptly returned or credited to the holder?s account. The settlement date for Securities tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase is expected to be October 29, 2020. P&G?s obligation to accept for payment and to pay for the Securities validly tendered in the tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a financing condition and certain other conditions described in the Offer to Purchase.

The holidays may look different this year, but with even more time spent at home there is no doubt that families will still gather around the table ? leading to a sink full of dirty dishes. Did you know that you can save 100 gallons of water a week this holiday season by running your dishwasher with Cascade Platinum every night, instead of washing all those dishes by hand? According to ENERGY STARﾃδεつづδづつｮ, running your sink uses four gallons of water every two minutes while running the dishwasher uses less than four gallons in an entire cycle. That?s why skipping the sink and running your dishwasher with even a small load is all it takes to save water. To encourage people to rethink the sink and consider running the dishwasher, Cascade and GE Appliances are gifting 100 households a new GEﾃδεつづδづつｮ Fingerprint Resistant Top Control with Stainless Steel Interior Dishwasher with Sanitize Cycle & Dry Boost with Hidden Controls as well as a year?s supply of Cascade Platinum ActionPacs. Through this sweepstakes alone, five million gallons of water will be saved over the average 10-year lifespan of the dishwashers! ?GE Appliances is constantly innovating to ensure that dishes are getting thoroughly cleaned and dried with every cycle,? says Cynthia Fanning, Vice President Product Management ? Dishwasher. ?We?re excited to be partnering with Cascade to give 100 households cleaner dishes and the gift of time back with their families this holiday season.? The GE Appliances ENERGY STARﾃδεつづδづつｮ-qualified dishwasher features Dry Boost? with Fan Assist technology that gets hard-to-dry items up to 3 times drier* than heated dry cycles along with steam and sanitization (reducing 99.999% of bacteria) ? functions that, when used nightly with Cascade Platinum, loosen tough soils, eliminating the need for soaking or pre-rinsing dishes. ?Water is a finite resource, and we can all do our part every day to help conserve it, which is why Cascade has spent decades developing ways for families to get cleaner dishes using less water,? says Martin Hettich, Senior Vice President of P&G?s North America Home Care business. ?As part of this commitment, and in the spirit of the holidays, we?re giving back to American families, and to our environment through a new project restoring water to the Lower Salt Basin in Phoenix, Arizona.? The water restoration project in the Lower Salt Basin will be Cascade?s second project with Change the Course. Earlier this year, the brand announced a partnership in the Sacramento River Basin that when complete, will restore more than 80 million gallons of water to people and the environment ? which is more than the water Cascade users in the Lower American Basin use each year running their dishwashers! ?Reducing at home water use provides some of the easiest ways to engage individuals in water conservation,? says Val Fishman, Chief Development Officer at the Bonneville Environmental Foundation. ?Thanks to Cascade, we can now not only save more water at home, but also continue supporting healthy freshwater ecosystems across the American West. Through their partnership with Change the Course, Cascade is significantly contributing to a network of on-the-ground projects that keep water in rivers and wetlands during times of water stress.?

Diese Maﾃδεつεδづつ殤ahme steigert die Wiederverwertbarkeit der Zahnpastatuben und ist Teil der Ambition-2030-Nachhaltigkeitsziele von P&G, nach denen die Verpackungen des Unternehmens zu 100 Prozent recycelbar bzw. wiederverwendbar sein werden. Die weltweit fﾃδεつεδづつｼhrenden Mundpflegemarken Crest und Oral-B sowie die europﾃδεつεδづつ､ische Marke Blend-a-med werden im Januar 2021 mit der Umstellung beginnen und diese bis zur vollstﾃδεつεδづつ､ndigen Umstellung im Jahr 2025 fortfﾃδεつεδづつｼhren. Zahnpastatuben werden tﾃδεつεδづつ､glich von Millionen von Verbrauchern genutzt. Ihre Zusammensetzung aus mehreren Materialien stellt Recyclinganlagen in aller Welt jedoch vor groﾃδεつεδづつ歹 Herausforderungen. Die Lﾃδεつεδづつｶsung hierfﾃδεつεδづつｼr stellen Tuben aus HDPE (High-Density-Polyethylen) dar, die einen vergleichbaren Produktschutz wie die derzeit verwendeten Tuben bieten und von zustﾃδεつεδづつ､ndigen nordamerikanischen und europﾃδεつεδづつ､ischen Stellen die Zertifizierung erhalten haben, dass sie mit bereits vorhandenen Recyclingtechnologien kompatibel sind. Diese HDPE-Tuben kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen dort recycelt werden, wo entsprechende Sammelsysteme existieren. Damit die richtige Lﾃδεつεδづつｶsung eingefﾃδεつεδづつｼhrt wird und Zahnpastatuben nachhaltiger produziert werden, steht Procter & Gamble in Gesprﾃδεつεδづつ､chen mit mehreren HDPE-Tubenlieferanten und hat bereits eine Vereinbarung mit Albﾃδεつεδづつｩa getroffen. Das Verpackungsunternehmen wird die Belieferung mit seinen proprietﾃδεつεδづつ､ren Tuben des Typs Greenleaf Generation 2 aufnehmen. Diese Tuben kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen ﾃδεつεδづつｼberall dort recycelt werden, wo entsprechende Sammelsysteme vorhanden sind. Tuben des Typs Greenleaf Generation 2 wurden von der nordamerikanischen Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) sowie von RecyClass und SUEZ.circpackﾃδεつづδづつｮ in Europa zertifiziert und kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen mit dem bereits vorhandenen effizienten Recyclingsystem fﾃδεつεδづつｼr HDPE-Flaschen recycelt werden. Um die APR-Zertifizierung zu erhalten, wurde der Nachweis erbracht, dass die Zahnpastatuben in hochwertiges Post-Consumer-HDPE-Harz umgewandelt und anschlieﾃδεつεδづつ歹nd zur Herstellung neuer Kunststoffflaschen wiederverwendet werden kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen. RecyClass ist eine unabhﾃδεつεδづつ､ngige, branchenﾃδεつεδづつｼbergreifende Plattform, die die Recyclingfﾃδεつεδづつ､higkeit von Materialien beurteilt und spezifische Empfehlungen zur Verbesserung von Verpackungen ausspricht, damit diese im Einklang mit aktuellen Recyclingtechnologien in Europa stehen. Die Plattform bescheinigt, dass die Zahnpastatuben-Technologie von Procter & Gamble mit den gﾃδεつεδづつ､ngigen HDPE-Recyclingverfahren kompatibel ist. Darﾃδεつεδづつｼber hinaus bescheinigt sie, dass die Zahnpastatuben samt Deckel von Procter & Gamble keine negativen Auswirkungen auf das derzeitige Recyclingverfahren fﾃδεつεδづつｼr HDPE-Behﾃδεつεδづつ､lter in Europa haben wird. ?Zahnpastatuben sind heute grﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ殳enteils nicht recycelbar. Mit der RecyClass-Zertifizierung fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die Greenleaf Generation 2-Technologie von Albﾃδεつεδづつｩa, die von P&G eingesetzt wird, sind wir jedoch auf dem richtigen Weg: zum einen, um das Recyclingbewusstsein fﾃδεつεδづつｼr Tuben zu erhﾃδεつεδづつｶhen, und zum anderen, um die Recyclingqualitﾃδεつεδづつ､t und die Recyclingquoten fﾃδεつεδづつｼr HDPE-Feststoffe in Europa zu steigern?, so Paolo Glerean, Vorstandsvorsitzender von RecyClass. Darﾃδεつεδづつｼber hinaus wurde die Sortierbarkeit der Tuben erfolgreich von SUEZ.circpackﾃδεつづδづつｮ getestet. Unter Beachtung des Sortierprotokolls von RecyClass wurde bestﾃδεつεδづつ､tigt, dass die Tuben in den richtigen Materialstrom einflieﾃδεつεδづつ歹n und zusammen mit den ﾃδεつεδづつｼbrigen HDPE-Materialien recycelt werden kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen. ?Die prﾃδεつεδづつ､zise Sortierung ist ein wesentlicher Schritt, um das Recycling sicherzustellen.

For a product to claim it kills a specific pathogen, Health Canada must conduct a data review and provide approval. Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner has been tested by a third-party lab, in accordance with Health Canada?s testing guidelines, and was shown to kill SARS-CoV-2 in five minutes. In addition to providing an initial kill of the virus that causes COVID-19, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner is approved to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses that cause common colds and the flu1. Microban 24 also provides a protective shield that keeps killing bacteria for up to 24 hours2, even when the surface is touched or contacted multiple times. ?Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner was introduced in February to give consumers a sanitizing product that works as hard as they do, providing protection against bacteria for up to 24 hours2,? said Martin Hettich, SVP North America Home Care, P&G. ?As consumers shifted from their standard sanitizing routine to one focused on protecting their homes against the COVID-19 virus, Procter & Gamble has been diligently working with scientists and health experts to ensure that Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner provides the effectiveness against the COVID-19 virus that people need.? While COVID-19 has been a primary concern for many Canadians over the past eight months, the Public Health Agency of Canada is stressing the importance of reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses, like the flu, this fall and winter as more important than ever.3 In addition to viral illnesses like the flu, the coming sick season is also the time of year when bacterial illnesses, such as strep throat, are more common.4 That?s why in 2020, it?s important to have a sanitizing tool that will initially kill both viruses and bacteria. However, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner will also continue killing 99.9% of bacteria2 for 24 hours to provide consumers with peace of mind that their home is protected during a time when the spread of bacteria is top of mind. ?Microban 24 has quickly become a trusted brand because it ensures that hard non-porous surfaces are not only sanitized from bacteria, but also stay that way for a full day2,? said Jason Tetro, a Germ Expert, Scientist and advisor to Microban 24. ?The new claim that Microban 24 initially kills COVID-19 means that there is no question about what to choose to keep your family safe?. ?We know that cleaning and disinfecting are top of mind with everyone during the pandemic, but especially for consumers who are returning to restaurants and hotels in a socially-distanced way,? said Paul Edmondson, Vice President North America P&G Professional. ?Our research corroborates that people visiting restaurants and hotels would like the facilities to use cleaning and disinfecting products from manufacturers or brands they know and trust. That?s why our trusted brands, like Microban 24, are the right choice for the cleaning programs put in place by our customers.? Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner is available in both Fresh Scent and Citrus Scent. The entire Microban 24 product lineup is sold at major retailers nationwide in store and online. Microban 24 is also sold through P&G Professional, the away from home division, to professional end-users in hospitality, non-acute healthcare, building cleaning and maintenance, and transportation.

Microban 24 does not provide 24-hour residual protection against viruses. 2 Microban 24 provides continuous protection against the Enterobacter aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, for up to 24 hours when used as directed on hard non-porous surfaces. 3 https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/prevention-risks.html 4 https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/laboratory-biosafety-biosecurity/pathogen-safety-data-sheets-risk-assessment/streptococcus-pyogenes.html About P&G P&G serves consumers around the world with one of the strongest portfolios of trusted, quality, leadership brands, including Alwaysﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Ambi Purﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Arielﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Bountyﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Charminﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Crestﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Dawnﾃδεつづδづつｮ Downyﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Fairyﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Febrezeﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Gainﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Gilletteﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Head & Shouldersﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Lenorﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Olayﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Oral-Bﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Pampersﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Panteneﾃδεつづδづつｮ, SK-IIﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Tideﾃδεつづδづつｮ, Vicksﾃδεつづδづつｮ, and Whisperﾃδεつづδづつｮ.

Inspired by the stories of women like Jamie, Olay Body wants to give women the tools they need to combat the snow and freezing temperatures that take a toll on skin. Olay Body also joined forces with board-certified dermatologist Dr. Sheila Farhang to share tips that will allow them to winter-proof their shower routine. Winter skin dryness is often caused by decreased humidity, and a lot of women aren?t aware that a solid skincare regimen begins in the shower, so it?s important to use products that aid in retaining moisture such as Olay?s Cleansing & Nourishing Body Wash and Rinse Off Body Conditioner in Shea Butter. Formulated with skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin B3 complex, Olay Body?s Premium Collection works overtime on your skin even during the harshest conditions. ""I love the winter because I get to ride the mountains and do what I love, but the snow and freezing temperatures take a toll on my skin,"" said Jamie Anderson, a professional snowboarder. ""A big part of being fearless is feeling good in my skin, and Olay?s Premium Body Care Collection really sets the tone for the day by moisturizing my skin from the second I jump out of the shower."" To learn more about how Jamie achieves visibly healthy skin throughout the winter, Olay Body met with her on the slopes to capture an exclusive interview that can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JLSy_vFPo8&feature=youtu.be. With more than 65 years of skin science and insights, Olay Body has worked tirelessly to provide women with an easy, trusted solution for their dry winter skin. In fact, a recent study revealed that 9 out of 10 female dermatologists would recommend Olay Premium Body Wash for their patients. Women can rest assured that Olay Premium Body Washes are a great choice since they are dermatologically approved by the Skin Health Alliance, an organization of independent dermatologists and skin scientists who have verified the products as safe and effective for dry skin improvement. ""It's important for women like Jamie who spend their days and nights outside in low temperatures to protect their skin with not only warm clothing but also products that are formulated with ingredients that moisturize to improve the skin barrier,"" said Dr. Sheila Farhang, board-certified dermatologist. ""I always recommend Olay?s Premium Body Wash to my patients during the winter because it improves skin three times better than the leading competitor, boosts the skin's moisture barrier, and improves skin dryness."" Cold temperature doesn?t have to be synonymous with dry, flaky skin. Dr. Sheila recommends the following three tips to brave the winter elements: Tip #1: I advise my patients to decrease shower length and use tepid water temperature instead of hot, especially in the winter. A hot shower may feel fantastic in the morning or after a long chilly day, but hot water actually strips away the skin's natural oils and disrupts surface lipids and proteins. This damage results in dry, irritated skin. Tip #2: Use a body cleanser that gets moisture deep into the skin's surface. Most traditional soaps strip away the skin's natural oils, but the products in the Olay Premium Body Wash Collection are formulated with supercharged ingredients, including niacinamide. With their unique lock-in-moisture technology, these formulas infuse moisture 10 layers deep without leaving a coated feeling on the skin. Tip #3: Moisturizing is key to your skin surviving cold temperatures. For an extra dose of moisture, instead of lotion, consider adding an in-shower moisturizer to your daily body care routine like Olay?s Rinse-Off Body Conditioner. Many lotions only provide temporary relief and have to be reapplied during your day. Olay?s Rinse-Off Body Conditioner fights dryness all day so you won?t need to apply moisturizer out of the shower.

In diesem Jahr wird Oral-B auf der Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2021 sein Engagement fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die kleinsten tﾃδεつεδづつ､glichen Gewohnheiten, wie z.B. die Verwendung einer elektrischen Zahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrste, herausstellen, um den grﾃδεつεδづつｶﾃδεつεδづつ殳mﾃδεつεδづつｶglichen positiven Einfluss auf die Gesundheit des ganzen Kﾃδεつεδづつｶrpers, der ganzen Familie und des ganzen Planeten zu erzielen. Oral-B bewerkstelligt dies mit seinem ersten virtuellen Erlebnis ﾃδεつεδづつｼberhaupt. Das virtuelle Erlebnis findet im Rahmen der virtuellen Plattform LifeLab Everyday von P&G statt und zeigt, wie Oral-B iO, die innovativste Zahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrste der Marke, die komplett neu konzipiert und gestaltet wurde, 100 % mehr Plaque entfernt als eine Handzahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrste. Der einzigartige, von Zahnﾃδεつεδづつ､rzten inspirierte runde Bﾃδεつεδづつｼrstenkopf umschlieﾃδεつεδづつ殳 mit seinen mikrovibrierenden Borsten jeden Zahn und erreicht so auch den Zahnfleischrand fﾃδεつεδづつｼr ein tiefes, professionelles Reinigungsgefﾃδεつεδづつｼhl ? jeden Tag. Der bimodale intelligente Drucksensor ist der erste seiner Art, der ein positives Feedback beim Zﾃδεつεδづつ､hneputzen gibt. Er erkennt und leitet den Benutzer an, im optimalen Druckbereich zu putzen, um Zahnfleisch und Zahnschmelz zu schﾃδεつεδづつｼtzen. Das lineare magnetische Antriebssystem liefert kontrollierte, gleichmﾃδεつεδづつ､ﾃδεつεδづつ殃ge Bewegungen vom Griff bis zu den Bﾃδεつεδづつｼrstenspitzen, erzeugt sanfte Mikrovibrationen fﾃδεつεδづつｼr ein angenehmeres Reinigungserlebnis und ﾃδεつεδづつｼbertrﾃδεつεδづつ､gt effizient mehr Energie direkt auf die Borstenspitzen. Das Smart Display mit personalisierten Reinigungsstufen ist mit einer intuitiven Benutzeroberflﾃδεつεδづつ､che ausgestattet, die wﾃδεつεδづつ､hrend des gesamten Reinigungsvorgangs Coaching und Motivation bietet, und verfﾃδεつεδづつｼgt ﾃδεつεδづつｼber bis zu sieben Reinigungsstufen fﾃδεつεδづつｼr ein hﾃδεつεδづつｶchst individuelles Reinigungserlebnis. Darﾃδεつεδづつｼber hinaus bietet die Oral-B-iO-App Artificial Intelligence Tracking. Dank kﾃδεつεδづつｼnstlicher Intelligenz, die sich auf Tausenden von aufgezeichneten Zahnputzsitzungen stﾃδεつεδづつｼtzt, bietet die App individuelle Nachverfolgung und Coaching in Echtzeit. Oral-B iO verfﾃδεつεδづつｼgt ﾃδεつεδづつｼber eine einfache und intuitive Benutzeroberflﾃδεつεδづつ､che, die den Verbraucher durch eine zweiminﾃδεつεδづつｼtige Zahnputzsitzung mit 3D-Zahnverfolgung fﾃδεつεδづつｼhrt und jedes Mal fﾃδεつεδづつｼr ein professionelles Putzgefﾃδεつεδづつｼhl sorgt. Kﾃδεつεδづつｼrzlich ging Oral-B eine Partnerschaft mit Scientific American ein, um die neue Forschungs- und Innovationsarbeit zu erkunden, die unser Verstﾃδεつεδづつ､ndnis der Verbindung zwischen Mundgesundheit und allgemeiner Gesundheit grundlegend verﾃδεつεδづつ､ndert. ?Aus mehr als 700 Studien geht hervor, dass gute Mundpflege ein einfacher Schritt zur Verbesserung der allgemeinen Gesundheit sein kann?, erlﾃδεつεδづつ､utert Jeremy A. Abbate, VP & Publisher bei Scientific American, ?Zahnfleischerkrankungen sind ein Signal, mit dem der Mund uns vor potenziell ernsteren Problemen warnt. Daher ist es wichtig, auf diese frﾃδεつεδづつｼhen Warnsignale zu achten.? Diese Warnsignale sind vielleicht nur Zahnfleischbluten oder gar Zahnverlust, sie kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen aber zu schwerwiegenderen Zustﾃδεつεδづつ､nden wie erhﾃδεつεδづつｶhten Schwangerschaftskomplikationen, kognitivem Verlust und einem mehr als doppelt so hohen Risiko fﾃδεつεδづつｼr Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes fﾃδεつεδづつｼhren. In klinischen Tests stellte Oral-B iO eine grﾃδεつεδづつｼndlichere Reinigung von Zﾃδεつεδづつ､hnen und Zahnfleisch unter Beweis. Die Anwender kﾃδεつεδづつｶnnen so einfach und effektiv viel fﾃδεつεδづつｼr einen Erhalt ihrer Mundgesundheit tun. Oral-B iO-Anwender erlebten: 100 Prozent gesﾃδεつεδづつｼnderes Zahnfleisch in nur einer Woche, im Vergleich zu Handzahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrsten; eine um das Sechsfache hﾃδεつεδづつｶhere Plaque-Entfernung entlang des Zahnfleischrandes, im Vergleich zu Handzahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrsten; 83 Prozent der Gingivitis-Patienten erzielten innerhalb von acht Wochen ein gesundes Zahnfleisch. Lisa Ernst, Senior Vice President, Research & Development, Oral Care, kommentierte: ?Eine elektrische Zahnbﾃδεつεδづつｼrste von Oral-B ist ein wirkungsvoller erster Schritt, um proaktiv gegen die Risiken von Zahnfleischerkrankungen vorzugehen. Wir geben Verbrauchern die Mﾃδεつεδづつｶglichkeit, die Gesundheit ihrer Familie zu Hause selbst in die Hand zu nehmen, und zwar mit Oral-B iO, das durch die Vorbeugung und Reduzierung von Zahnfleischentzﾃδεつεδづつｼndungen die Gesundheit des Zahnfleisches fﾃδεつεδづつｶrdert.? Darﾃδεつεδづつｼber hinaus wird P&G LifeLab Everyday die neuesten Nachhaltigkeitsverpflichtungen von P&G Oral Care vorstellen, das gesunde Mundpflegegewohnheiten fﾃδεつεδづつｶrdert, um die Gesundheit der Menschen zu verbessern und gleichzeitig die Auswirkungen auf unseren Planeten zu reduzieren. Gesunde Gewohnheiten fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die Umwelt bedeuten eine Welt, in der jeder unseren Planeten und seine natﾃδεつεδづつｼrlichen Ressourcen respektiert.

Ceux-ci touchent l?ensemble de la chaﾃδεつεδづつｮne d?approvisionnement de Tide et de ses initiatives communautaires aux ﾃδεつεδづつ液ats-Unis et au Canada. Tide repense le nettoyage dans son parcours pour dﾃδεつεδづつｩcarboner la lessive ﾃδεつεδづつ chaque ﾃδεつεδづつｩtape ? de la conception, la fabrication et la distribution ﾃδεつεδづつ l?utilisation par le consommateur et la fin de la vie utile du produit. Pour atteindre cet objectif, la marque mettra l?accent sur les domaines principaux. En 2020, Tide a rﾃδεつεδづつｩduit les ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de gaz ﾃδεつεδづつ effet de serre (GES) de sa fabrication directe de plus de 75 pour cent par annﾃδεつεδづつｩe comparativement ﾃδεつεδづつ la dﾃδεつεδづつｩcennie passﾃδεつεδづつｩe et s?est fixﾃδεつεδづつｩ un nouvel objectif consistant ﾃδεつεδづつ rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire de moitiﾃδεつεδづつｩ les ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de GES des usines de fabrication directe d?ici 2030. Sachant que plus de deux tiers de l?ensemble des ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de GES d?un cycle de vie d?une lessive sont ﾃδεつεδづつｩmis lors de la phase d?utilisation par le consommateur, Tide concentre ses efforts pour minimiser la consommation d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩnergie dans le cycle de lavage. Pour cela, Tide lance ﾃδεつεδづつｩgalement une campagne ﾃδεつεδづつｩducatrice considﾃδεつεδづつｩrable au printemps 2021 qui incitera les consommateurs nord-amﾃδεつεδづつｩricains ﾃδεつεδづつ passer ﾃδεつεδづつ la lessive ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide. Le but de faire passer trois brassﾃδεつεδづつｩes de lessive sur quatre ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide d?ici 2030 aux ﾃδεつεδづつ液ats-Unis et au Canada a le potentiel de rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire les ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de GES de 4,25 millions de tonnes mﾃδεつεδづつｩtriques (tm), soit l?ﾃδεつεδづつｩquivalent d?environ un million de voitures de moins sur les routes pendant un an. Au cours de la dﾃδεつεδづつｩcennie (2020 ﾃδεつεδづつ 2030), l?effet de cette action se traduira par une rﾃδεつεδづつｩduction cumulative de 27 millions tm en CO2. De plus, d?ici la fin de la dﾃδεつεδづつｩcennie, la marque dﾃδεつεδづつｩcuplera son programme Tide Loads of Hope qui fournit des vﾃδεつεδづつｪtements propres ﾃδεつεδづつ des millions de personnes en cas de besoin, surtout auprﾃδεつεδづつｨs des collectivitﾃδεつεδづつｩs les plus touchﾃδεつεδづつｩes par le changement climatique alors que les catastrophes naturelles s?aggravent. L?annonce de l?Ambition de Tide s?appuie sur l?Ambition de sa sociﾃδεつεδづつｩtﾃδεつεδづつｩ mﾃδεつεδづつｨre Procter & Gamble de mﾃδεつεδづつｪme que son chemin dﾃδεつεδづつｩfini vers la neutralitﾃδεつεδづつｩ climatique, tous deux reposant sur la conviction que la prochaine dﾃδεつεδづつｩcennie s?avﾃδεつεδづつｨre un crﾃδεつεδづつｩneau crucial pour accﾃδεつεδづつｩlﾃδεつεδづつｩrer les mesures prises pour protﾃδεつεδづつｩger le climat, sans perdre de temps. ﾃδεつづδづつｫ Tout le monde doit, de maniﾃδεつεδづつｨre urgente, adresser l?urgence climatique ﾃδεつεδづつ laquelle nous faisons face. Aujourd?hui, Tide annonce une sﾃδεつεδづつｩrie d?objectifs visant ﾃδεつεδづつ rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire son empreinte carbone de sa chaﾃδεつεδづつｮne de valeur complﾃδεつεδづつｨte ﾃδεつづδづつｻ, a dit Shailesh Jejurikar, Prﾃδεつεδづつｩsident et directeur gﾃδεつεδづつｩnﾃδεつεδづつｩral de la division des produits soins pour la maison et lessive, Procter & Gamble. ﾃδεつづδづつｫ L?ambition de Tide est de faire de la lessive ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide la norme de l?industrie. Plus de deux tiers des ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions du cycle de vie de la lessive proviennent du lavage des vﾃδεつεδづつｪtements ﾃδεつεδづつ la maison. Passer de l?eau chaude ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide rﾃδεつεδづつｩduit jusqu?ﾃδεつεδづつ 90 pour cent l?utilisation d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩnergie et peut faire ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomiser jusqu?ﾃδεつεδづつ 130 $ par an aux Canadiens. Aujourd?hui, nous nous appuyons sur les 75 ans d?innovation de Tide pour faire de chaque brassﾃδεつεδづつｩe de lessive Tide une brassﾃδεつεδづつｩe de bien. ﾃδεつづδづつｻ Mieux pour la planﾃδεつεδづつｨte Le parcours de Tide pour dﾃδεつεδづつｩcarboner la lessive comprend un objectif de rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire les ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de GES dans tout le cycle de lessive. Aujourd?hui, les usines de fabrication Tide utilisent 100 pour cent d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩlectricitﾃδεつεδづつｩ renouvelable. Tide progressera dans son objectif de rﾃδεつεδづつｩduction des ﾃδεつεδづつｩmissions de gaz ﾃδεつεδづつ effet de serre ﾃδεつεδづつ travers un projet de dﾃδεつεδづつｩveloppement pilote en collaboration avec Opus12, une entreprise en dﾃδεつεδづつｩmarrage de la Silicon Valley pionniﾃδεつεδづつｨre dans la transformation du carbone. Cette collaboration permettra d?explorer la technologie de capture et d?utilisation du dioxyde de carbone de l?entreprise afin d?incorporer des ingrﾃδεつεδづつｩdients CO2 MadeTM dans la fabrication de Tide. Tide se concentrera ﾃδεつεδづつｩgalement sur une mission ﾃδεつεδづつ long terme visant ﾃδεつεδづつ faire de la lessive ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide une norme industrielle aux ﾃδεつεδづつ液ats-Unis et au Canada, contrairement aux normes actuelles selon lesquelles moins de la moitiﾃδεつεδづつｩ des brassﾃδεつεδづつｩes de lessive se fait ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide. Passer de l?eau chaude ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide rﾃδεつεδづつｩduit jusqu?ﾃδεつεδづつ 90 % l?utilisation d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩnergie lors de la phase de lavage et peut faire ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomiser jusqu?ﾃδεつεδづつ 130 $ par an aux consommateurs canadiens. ﾃδεつづδづつｫ ﾃδεつεδづつ液ablir un monde durable pour les gﾃδεつεδづつｩnﾃδεつεδづつｩrations ﾃδεつεδづつ venir requiert que les marques les plus populaires prennent une approche comprﾃδεつεδづつｩhensive vis-ﾃδεつεδづつ-vis de la rﾃδεつεδづつｩduction de leur impact environnemental tout en posant des actions qui vont au-delﾃδεつεδづつ de leur propre empreinte ﾃδεつづδづつｻ, a dit Sheila Bonini, vice-prﾃδεつεδづつｩsidente principale de l?engagement du secteur privﾃδεつεδづつｩ du Fonds mondial pour la nature. ﾃδεつづδづつｫ Les marques ont l?occasion unique de collaborer et de communiquer avec des millions de consommateurs ﾃδεつεδづつ la maison pour aider ﾃδεつεδづつ ﾃδεつεδづつｩduquer et ﾃδεつεδづつ motiver les gens ﾃδεつεδづつ faire de simples changements qui s?additionnent pour faire une diffﾃδεつεδづつｩrence importante pour notre planﾃδεつεδづつｨte. ﾃδεつづδづつｻ Un changement des comportements ﾃδεつεδづつ une telle ﾃδεつεδづつｩchelle nﾃδεつεδづつｩcessitera un investissement important ainsi qu?une collaboration dans l?ensemble de l?industrie. Afin de progresser vers cet objectif, Tide lancera dans les prochaines semaines une campagne d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩducation des consommateurs en faveur de l?eau froide, dﾃδεつεδづつｩmontrant que la marque ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomique la plus populaire en eau chaude ne peut rivaliser avec Tide en eau froide2 et en ﾃδεつεδづつｩduquant les consommateurs sur la faﾃδεつεδづつｧon dont un lavage ﾃδεつεδづつ l?eau froide peut leur permettre d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomiser de l?argent et de l?ﾃδεつεδづつｩnergie. D?autres mesures visant ﾃδεつεδづつ rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire l?empreinte carbone globale de la marque d?ici 2030 comprennent une rﾃδεつεδづつｩduction de moitiﾃδεつεδづつｩ de l?utilisation du plastique vierge dans les emballages (par rapport ﾃδεつεδづつ 2020), la rﾃδεつεδづつｩalisation d?ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomies par le biais de la rﾃδεつεδづつｩduction du poids, de l?exploration de solutions d?emballage innovantes telles que l?ﾃδεつεδづつｩcoboﾃδεつεδづつｮte et de l?augmentation de l?utilisation du contenu recyclﾃδεつεδづつｩ aprﾃδεつεδづつｨs consommation. Actuellement, les bouteilles Tide utilisent au moins 25 pour cent de contenu recyclﾃδεつεδづつｩ aprﾃδεつεδづつｨs consommation. De plus, Tide s?est engagﾃδεつεδづつｩ ﾃδεつεδづつ utiliser 100 % d?emballages recyclables pour tous ses produits d?ici 2030. L?engagement de Tide envers l?empreinte environnementale va au-delﾃδεつεδづつ des emballages et touche les produits eux-mﾃδεつεδづつｪmes. L?aspect sﾃδεつεδづつｩcuritaire des formules de Tide, qui touche la santﾃδεつεδづつｩ environnementale et humaine, restera une prioritﾃδεつεδづつｩ, en s?appuyant sur l?histoire de Tide d?aller plus loin encore que la conformitﾃδεつεδづつｩ rﾃδεつεδづつｩglementaire pour assurer la sﾃδεつεδづつｩcuritﾃδεつεδづつｩ des ingrﾃδεつεδづつｩdients et soutenir les efforts aux cﾃδεつεδづつｴtﾃδεつεδづつｩs de P&G pour promulguer des politiques de divulgation des ingrﾃδεつεδづつｩdients. Rﾃδεつεδづつｩaliser des ﾃδεつεδづつｩconomies d?eau sera ﾃδεつεδづつｩgalement en tﾃδεつεδづつｪte des prioritﾃδεつεδづつｩs, car Tide vise ﾃδεつεδづつ rﾃδεつεδづつｩduire de 40 pour cent l?utilisation d?eau dans ses usines (d?ici 2030 par rapport ﾃδεつεδづつ 2010), tout en continuant ﾃδεつεδづつ dﾃδεつεδづつｩvelopper ses produits de faﾃδεつεδづつｧon ﾃδεつεδづつ utiliser moins d?eau, que ce soit dans les formules ou dans le cycle de lavage. Les mesures prises par Tide aujourd?hui sont les derniﾃδεつεδづつｨres mises en place aprﾃδεつεδづつｨs 75 ans consacrﾃδεつεδづつｩs ﾃδεつεδづつ offrir un meilleur nettoyage pour les consommateurs et pour la planﾃδεつεδづつｨte. Il s?agit d?un parcours sans fin qui, ﾃδεつεδづつ ce jour, a connu plusieurs ﾃδεつεδづつｩtapes notables, notamment une coalition menﾃδεつεδづつｩe par Tide pour introduire un systﾃδεつεδづつｨme de recyclage des plastiques colorﾃδεつεδづつｩs dans les annﾃδεつεδづつｩes 80, l?introduction de capsules Tide Pods nﾃδεつεδづつｩcessitant peu d?eau et aux formules peu moussantes, la conception de l?ﾃδεつεδづつｩcoboﾃδεつεδづつｮte fabriquﾃδεつεδづつｩe avec jusqu?ﾃδεつεδづつ 75 pour cent moins d?emballage que les bouteilles traditionnelles et le dﾃδεつεδづつｩveloppement d?une formule en eau froide qui a ﾃδεつεδづつｩtﾃδεつεδづつｩ intﾃδεつεδづつｩgrﾃδεつεδづつｩe dans la gamme de produits Tide. Mieux pour tout le monde Alors que Tide se tourne vers un avenir ﾃδεつεδづつｩcologique plus sain, elle reste dﾃδεつεδづつｩterminﾃδεつεδづつｩe ﾃδεつεδづつ conserver les communautﾃδεつεδづつｩs qu?elle sert au c?ur de sa marque, particuliﾃδεつεδづつｨrement celles touchﾃδεつεδづつｩes par les changements climatiques.

Maintenant, la marque cherche ﾃδεつεδづつ renforcer cette histoire afin d?aider des millions de personnes dans le besoin en ﾃδεつεδづつｩlargissant la portﾃδεつεδづつｩe du programme Tide Loads of Hope.

However, according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, nearly half of children aged 6-11 are affected by tooth decay. While largely preventable, tooth decay is exacerbated with children in underserved communities, who are twice as likely to suffer from this condition, and their dental diseases are more than twice as likely to go untreated. It can also lead to missed school, trouble eating, sleeping and heightened risk of infection. 1 With a commitment of healthier smiles for all, Crest and Oral-B Kids are teaming up with actor, Miles Brown on a new Conquer Cavities 2Gether initiative. Conquer Cavities 2Gether encourages kids and parents to take the pledge to brush for two minutes, twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste. For every pledge, Crest and Oral-B Kids will donate up to 10,000 Conquer Cavities kits, including toothpaste, toothbrushes and educational materials, to children and families in need. ?Growing up in front of the camera, my parents instilled in me the importance of a healthy smile,? said Brown, ?That?s why I?m excited to partner with Crest and Oral-B Kids to inspire and encourage kids and parents to take the pledge, so they can put their best smile forward ? no matter where their journey takes them.? Crest and Oral-B Kids are also proud to partner with America?s ToothFairy, a nonprofit resource provider that has helped nonprofit dental clinics provide dental care to more than 8 million children nationwide. Through our partnership, we will distribute Conquer Cavities 2Gether kits to five partner dental clinics in underserved communities around the country. ?We know there are millions of kids in the U.S. with restricted access to dental care and some even lack basic items like their own toothbrush,? said Jill Malmgren, Executive Director, America?s ToothFairy, ?We?re thrilled to collaborate with Crest and Oral-B Kids to get Conquer Cavities 2Gether kits to the kids and families that need them most.? This campaign is part of the Crest and Oral-B aspiration to enable 100% of Americans to have access to oral care products, oral health education and dental care. In 2020 alone, Crest and Oral-B donated more than $2.5 million in products and care to support healthy smiles across the country. The brands have also provided more than $140 million in continuing education to dental professionals over the past 10 years and offered educational materials that make it easy for dental professionals, parents and teachers to educate their kids about the importance of oral care. ?A smile is priceless, and every kid deserves to grow up with a happy and healthy one,? said Carlos Quintero, Vice President, North America Oral Care, P&G ?Especially knowing the connection between oral health and whole body health, we are committed to taking action to ensure every child is free and proud to show off their smile to the world. Just one pledge can provide a family with oral care product and education to help build healthy oral habits to last a lifetime.?

Partners include science educator and media personality Bill Nye, neuroscientist and actress Mayim Bialik, YouTube content creator Nick Uhas, as well as microbiologists Kennen Hutchison and Jessica Malaty Rivera. A new survey* by Bounty revealed that Americans are spending more time cleaning than ever before and nearly 92% have changed their behavior in the past year to clean more thoroughly, frequently, or in areas that had been previously untouched. Despite this uptick in concern for a hygienic home, many continue to reach for a used dishcloth to wipe up a spill or mess. ?Used dishcloths can be a haven for bacteria,? says infectious disease expert and microbiologist Jessica Malaty Rivera. ?Because they are multipurpose and often go unwashed between uses, the wet and absorbent nature of the product can provide a flourishing environment for bacteria to grow.? When asked how often consumers wash their kitchen towels, the survey revealed that just 11% will replace or wash their dishcloth after a full week of usage. According to Kennen Hutchison, a virology PhD student, ?Studies** have confirmed that used dishcloths can contain E. coli and coliform bacteria (fecal contamination) which isn?t visible to the naked eye. And when you wipe up a spill on the counter with a used towel, or dry a dish, you could cross contaminate multiple surfaces.? Through an educational video series that will include live demonstrations and creative experiments, this troupe of scientists and influencers will share their tips and recommendations to help consumers achieve a healthy home. Experts such as Rivera and Hutchison recommend using a fresh paper towel, rather than a used dishcloth, to wipe up and throw away messes, and help reduce the risk of cross contamination from one surface to another. Consumers can follow the series of experiments on social using #HygieneBeginsWithBounty or at @bountypapertowels. * A survey conducted by www.OnePoll.com on the topic of cleaning behaviors was distributed in February 2021 to a sample group of 2,005 respondents with the US general population. **A published study on ResearchGate.com from 2014 found that out of 82 kitchen hand towels collected across the U.S. and Canada, coliform bacteria (fecal contamination) was present in nearly 9 out of 10 and E. coli was present in 1 in 4.?",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005235/en/Bounty-Paper-Towels-Reveals-Potential-Spots-for-Bacteria-in-the-Home,businesswire.com,5,cincinnatibusiness wirepgs bounty paper towel setting uncover potential hidden bacteria home recruited key scientist influencers unveil microbe present offer expert tip get level clean people want home partner include science educator medium personality bill nye neuroscientist actress mayim bialik youtube content creator nick uhas well microbiologist kennen hutchison jessica malaty rivera new survey bounty revealed american spending time cleaning ever nearly changed behavior past year clean thoroughly frequently area previously untouched despite uptick concern hygienic home many continue reach used dishcloth wipe spill mess used dishcloth bacteria say infectious disease expert microbiologist jessica malaty rivera multipurpose often go unwashed us wet absorbent nature product provide flourishing environment bacteria grow asked often consumer wash kitchen towel survey revealed replace wash dishcloth full week usage according kennen hutchison virology phd student study confirmed used dishcloth contain e coli coliform bacteria fecal contamination isnt visible naked eye wipe spill counter used towel dry dish could cross contaminate multiple surface educational video series include live demonstration creative experiment troupe scientist influencers share tip recommendation help consumer achieve healthy home expert rivera hutchison recommend using fresh paper towel rather used dishcloth wipe throw away mess help reduce risk cross contamination one surface another consumer follow series experiment social using hygienebeginswithbounty bountypapertowels survey conducted topic cleaning behavior distributed february sample group respondent u general population published study researchgatecom found kitchen hand towel collected across u canada coliform bacteria fecal contamination present nearly e coli present,0.9657,0.48285,0.49135,-0.0085,Negative Impact

That?s why Charmin introduced its newest prototype ? BRB Bot ? so no one will ever know you stepped away. BRB Bot is the first-ever ?bot? that will keep you logged on by creating a digital twin that swaps your live video feed with an AI-powered version of yourself. It was unveiled for the first time during a virtual press conference today with Niecy Nash, comedian, actor, television host, model and producer and Juju Smith Schuster, Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver. Over the past year, the world around us has gone almost completely digital. And yet, it?s tougher than ever to do your ?business? without interrupting your business. While you are on the throne, BRB Bot listens and responds as if you are still on the video call and features a range of realistic human reactions, such as laughing at your boss? terrible jokes, looking thoughtfully into the distance, pretending to search for the unmute button and much more. ?I know I?m not the only one who?s brought their computer into the bathroom, scared that I forgot to leave the mute button on and camera off,"" said Niecy. ""So, when Charmin approached me to test BRB Bot, I was like ?FINALLY someone figured out a way I can sneak off to the throne to handle my business, if you know what I mean."" BRB Bot, which is currently beta-only, is a desktop app that accesses the camera feed and uses machine learning, natural language processing and tone analysis to listen to video calls and serve up the appropriate reactions in real-time so no one notices you?ve left to take a bio break. There are no current plans to release BRB Bot. ?From video conference calls, to gaming, to sports, we?ve been forced to adapt to living and working virtually; however, one thing that hasn?t changed is when nature calls, you have to answer? no ifs, ands or butts about it,? said Rob Reinerman, Charmin Vice President, Procter & Gamble. ?At Charmin, we?re obsessed with delivering a better bathroom experience whether it be providing the best toilet paper or inventing other novel ways to help people Enjoy the Go. BRB Bot is yet another way Charmin is exploring better bathroom technology that could one day become reality.? ?I?m on non-stop video calls and press conferences for 2-3 hours at a time some days. Charmin?s BRB Bot is a hilariously real solve for not having to say ?BRB? gotta GO,? to a room full of reporters. I just switch it on and they don?t know I?m gone,? Juju said.

These athletes are the focus in the latest chapter of the company?s worldwide ?Lead with Love? consumer campaign, which unites P&G?s longstanding Citizenship efforts of Community Impact, Equality & Inclusion, and Environmental Sustainability. P&G believes the Olympic Games have tremendous power to unite the world through sport; in Tokyo, and in partnership with the International Olympic Committee, P&G is celebrating athletes and their inspiring acts of good. Launched today, the short film ?Love Leads to Good? celebrates the important role all parents have in raising their children to be good. It is in those quiet moments of teaching over a lifetime that develop a child into a champion ? as an athlete ? and as a human being. This film depicts how the choice to take action to be a good person reflects the lessons we?ve been taught by those who love us. Often these lessons lead to the moments that shine brightest ? even on the Olympic stage: displays of respect and good sportsmanship, extending kindness to our rivals, and perseverance in the face of adversity. In celebration of the athletes who show their goodness on and off the field of play, P&G also launched the film ?Your Goodness is Your Greatness.? Narrated from the perspective of proud parents, the film features Olympic and Paralympic athletes who are leading with love and showing the world that the true measure of greatness is goodness. U.S. athletes in the film include six-time Olympic Gold Medalist Allyson Felix, Track and Field; four-time World Champion Carissa Moore, Surfing; and Olympic Gold Medalist, Elena Delle Donne, Basketball. ?Over the past decade, we have been honored and humbled to tell the stories of amazing athletes and the families who have supported them on the journey to achieving their Olympic and Paralympic dreams,? said P&G Chief Brand Officer, Marc Pritchard. ?When those dreams were put on hold in 2020, we were inspired as they moved beyond their own disappointment and stepped up to help others and serve their communities. By putting others above themselves and lending their time, talent, and resources to help those in need ? these accomplished athletes show that their goodness is their greatness.? ?Love Leads to Good? and ?Your Goodness is Your Greatness? build upon the iconic ?Thank You, Mom? campaign and include a call to action to ?lead with love? through acts of good. Both films will appear in full form digitally or in short form on television in more than 15 countries. ?Love Leads to Good? and ?Your Goodness is Your Greatness? can be viewed on P&G?s YouTube channel. Athletes for Good Fund Recipients Announced P&G, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Paralympic Committee are proud to announce the 52 recipients of the Athletes for Good Fund. After seeing the amazing stories of athletes doing good in their communities, P&G was inspired to take action to encourage even more positive change. Totaling more than $500,000, the Athletes for Good Fund celebrates and fuels the work of Olympic and Paralympic athletes and hopefuls who are partnering with charitable causes to help others and serve their communities in the areas of Community Impact, Equality & Inclusion, and Environmental Sustainability. Each $10,000 grant goes to the charitable organization the athletes support, contributing to P&G?s Lead with Love consumer campaign commitment of 2,021 Acts of Good in 2021. The Athletes for Good recipient group includes 28 Olympic athletes and hopefuls, and 24 Paralympic athletes and hopefuls, representing 20 countries, and 25 sports. In all, 11 of the recipients hail from the U.S., including: Melissa Stockwell, Paratriathlon: As the co-founder of Dare2Tri, Melissa helps to enhance the lives of people with physical disabilities and visual impairments through sport. Simone Manuel, Swimming: Works with The Conscious Kid to take action to disrupt racism in young children and promote racial identity development to youth through reading.

Shining a Spotlight on Action for Equality & Inclusion P&G?s global Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 campaign includes a documentary-style film series co-created with the IOC entitled ?Good is Gold,? which tells the moving, real-life stories of four Olympic and Paralympic athletes and hopefuls as they take action against bias and inequality. The ?Good is Gold? series includes the stories of Tom Daley (Great Britain, Diving), Zeina Nassar (Germany, Boxing) and two U.S. athletes: Six-time Olympic Gold Medalist Allyson Felix, Track and Field, who uses her platform to raise awareness of the risks and dangers faced by Black women during pregnancy and childbirth. Paralympian Scout Bassett, Track and Field, who defied the odds to become a champion and pays it forward by mentoring young athletes to push through societal barriers. ?In the past, my athletic achievements were my focus and my prize,? said Felix. ?While I?m unbelievably proud of and thankful for the medals, the podiums, and the experiences, the birth of my daughter Camryn ? the joy of my life ? is what helped me elevate my voice to create awareness around the Black maternal mortality crisis. Because of her, and the strong female role models in my life, I choose to put those lessons into action by advocating for Black mothers everywhere.? ?Good is Gold? films can be viewed at: www.Olympics.com/PG. Consistent with long-standing commitments, several P&G brands are running Olympic Games programs that support athletes and address important topics like equality and inclusion: Always is helping girls stay in sports. They?re teaming up with inspirational women from around the world, including Olympic Gold Medalist Elena Delle Donne, Basketball; Olympic hopeful Mariah Duran, Skateboarding; Olympic Gold Medalist Laurie Hernandez, Gymnastics; Paralympian Scout Bassett, Track and Field; and girls? education advocate Malala Yousafzai, to showcase the many ways sports can help girls build confidence, shape skills and fuel their future. Secret Deodorant is proud to continue its partnership with Olympic Gold Medalist Alex Morgan, Soccer. Secret is raising awareness for and inspiring others to take action around equal representation and equal compensation. SK-II will set up a #CHANGEDESTINY fund this year, contributing $1 for every view garnered on each SK-II STUDIO film, including one featuring Olympic Gold Medalist Simone Biles, Gymnastics, in support of women in pursuing their destiny to create positive change.

Brown to launch the second installment of its ?Do It Every Night? initiative, revealing a dirty little secret: running your dishwasher every night uses less water and energy than washing dishes by hand. In-home water and energy usage increased exponentially at the height of the pandemic, with the average U.S. home using nearly 21 percent more water per day, according to Phyn. Energy use has also spiked, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, with Americans spending an additional $6 billion dollars on at-home power consumption. The good news? We can all help reduce water and energy consumption by making small changes to our daily habits, including the way we wash our dishes. According to ENERGY STAR, certified dishwashers use less than four gallons of water per cycle compared to handwashing, which uses four gallons every two minutes. That means if you wash dishes by hand for just 10 minutes a day, switching to the dishwasher allows you to save 100 gallons per week. Plus, the dishwasher uses less energy than washing dishes at the sink, saving you up to $130** on your energy bill each year. ??Many people are surprised to learn that dishwashers are actually designed to be more efficient than the way most of us hand wash our dishes,? says Kristine Decker, Vice President of P&G?s North America Dish Care business. ?According to ENERGY STAR, running the dishwasher uses half the energy compared to washing your dishes by hand. That?s why no one should feel guilty about letting the dishwasher handle the day?s worth of dishes.? Since 1955, North America?s #1 recommended dishwasher detergent brand has continually innovated its products and methods to improve dishwashing and reduce water consumption. In fact, Cascade was the first brand to create a detergent that allowed people to skip pre-rinsing dishes before loading them into the dishwasher. Most recently, the brand introduced Cascade Platinum ActionPacs, with 50 percent more cleaning power. Cascade Platinum ActionPacs latch on to and break down leftover food solids, tackling the dirtiest of dishes without the need for a pre-rinse. The brand?s current ?Do It Every Night? initiative is part of Cascade?s ongoing commitment to innovate and to advocate for responsible water consumption. Last year, Cascade turned the ?dishwashing is wasteful? myth on its head and used humor to motivate people to make changes in their dishwashing habits to help save water. Today, the brand is kicking off a partnership with actor Sterling K. Brown to help encourage people to forgo hand washing for the dishwasher through another educational and tongue-in-cheek content series urging people to save water and energy. ?We live in California, so saving water is always top of mind for me and my family,? said Sterling K. Brown. ?We used to wash most of our dishes by hand. Then, I learned a little secret ? that the dishwasher actually uses less than 4 gallons of water per cycle, so it turns out we were wasting a lot of water and energy by hand washing. Not anymore. Now, I let the dishwasher handle the dishes every night ? saving water, time and energy.? In addition to helping people save water at home, Cascade helps restore water to the environment through a partnership with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation?s ?Change the Course? program.? Currently, Cascade is partnering on multiple projects in water-stressed regions across the country to rehabilitate important natural waterways and habitats, including the Sacramento River Basin, one of California?s most important water sources.? ?Water issues across North America remain a top concern for people and businesses alike. Over the years, we?ve been able to bring companies and the public together to shrink our human water footprint and restore water to regions in need,? says Val Fishman, Chief Development Officer at BEF. ?Not only is Cascade helping people conserve water in their daily lives, but the brand has supported projects that will restore more than 338 million gallons of freshwater to rivers and wetlands across the United States.? To learn more about the effort, visit CascadeClean.com. *More dishwasher brands in North America recommend Cascade over any other automatic dishwashing detergent brand, recommendations as part of co-marketing agreements. **When switching from using 180 gallons of water per week handwashing to automatic dishwashing 4 times a week, electricity rate of 11c/kWh (US). About Cascade In 1953, Cascade entered the automatic dishwashing market with claims of ?spotless dishes? to the four percent of households with dishwashers. The fast-moving world of household innovations was just in its beginning stages, and Cascade stayed at the forefront for the next 50 years by developing a range of automatic dishwashing products perfect for a variety of families, needs, and lifestyles. Today, with decades of experience and dishwashers in more than 60-percent of households, Cascade continues to grow, striving for immaculate dishes every time with its brilliant automatic dishwashing powders, gels, pacs, and additives.

Pampers Pure Protection Hybrid Diapers offer: A disposable insert made with a plant-based liner, enriched with shea butter and other thoughtfully selected materials. It features Pampers? trusted absorbent core and high leg cuffs to help prevent leaks. ?One size fits most? super soft reusable cloth covers made with premium fabrics, adjustable leg elastics and waist snaps that will last through multiple changes. The machine washable covers are easy to clean with simple laundering instructions. 14 playful and fun prints (fruits, animals, and sweet messages) so you can customize your collection.

Campaign,"CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With the long-awaited Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 ahead, Pantene is partnering with frontrunner and most decorated US Olympian in women?s track and field history, Allyson Felix, to look back and celebrate the moments that define a legacy through its ?What?s Your Legacy? campaign. The campaign featuring Allyson and her daughter, Camryn, acknowledges that legacy is not made of only wins or medals, but the journey it took to get there; paving a path for the next generation of women and girls. ?I am thankful to have Pantene in my corner celebrating my legacy during this Olympic run,? said Felix. ?After having Camryn, defining my legacy became so much more than my accomplishments on the track?she inspired me to use my voice and make a difference for her and for the world, and I now feel that legacy most when I spend time teaching her how to care for her curls, further rooting our connection and legacy together.? For Allyson, suffering pregnancy complications with Camryn propelled her to take a stand and bring attention to a systemic issue in need of change. She became a voice for millions of mothers of color who are subject to healthcare inequalities and have a higher maternal mortality rate, helping to create a better future for generations to come. ?Pantene celebrates everyone whose legacy is built on courage, strength, and advocating for what is right,? said Jessica Ettelson, Pantene Brand Director. ?We are so proud of the athlete, activist, and mother that Allyson is and are excited to share the legacy she has built for her daughter and the world, while inspiring others to build their own.?

While the reasons that contribute to this low percentage necessitate a broader conversation on systemic racism in medicine, one leading cause is that Black students interested in pursuing careers in healthcare generally have more barriers to overcome to enter and stay in the field, like less access to wealth, housing, education, and healthcare, which can then be followed by instances of racism and systemic bias in both training and the workplace. To help alleviate some of the obstacles Black students face in pursuing these careers, Tampax launched the Flow It Scholarship program as part of its larger Flow it Forward project, in partnership with P&G?s #TakeOnRace Fund, which aims to end the misinformation surrounding health and period care and promote equal representation and access to medical resources. Through UNCF (United Negro College Fund) and their 37 partner HBCU schools, Tampax will provide $200,000 annual assistance every year for 4 years to support the next generation of Black students in medicine. ?The last year has been unlike any other, and unprecedented events like a global pandemic and racial unrest have not only elevated awareness of the racial disparities that exist in healthcare, but they have also made pursuing degrees even more difficult for Black women,? says Dr. Michael L. Lomax, UNCF President and CEO. ?The Flow It Forward scholarship combines Tampax and UNCF?s shared commitment to investing in education, thus making a step to reducing racial disparities and increase Black representation among healthcare professionals. We agree that ?A mind is a terrible thing to waste, but a wonderful thing to invest in,? and we are happy to partner with Tampax on this four-year scholarship program.? Research has shown that disparities can start in early childhood education with a lack of resources and funding, where students can have less access and exposure to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) training. Fast forward to higher education, some healthcare programs require traditional four-year degrees instead of community or junior college degrees, which may inadvertently create structural barriers for Black candidates. Beyond the Flow It Forward Scholarship, the Tampax Flow it Forward project supports various organizations fighting to accelerate change for Black Americans facing racism. Part of reducing healthcare disparities includes investing in education today to help increase the number of Black physicians and healthcare workers in the future. ?Increasing the presence of Black people in the healthcare field is an issue that will take time. For years we [Tampax] have been committed to supporting various organizations and individuals to end stigmas surrounding health and period care,? says Camille Zahniser, Senior Brand Director of North America Tampax. ?Supporting and trusting UNCF?s incredible experience and expertise in funding education at HBCUs will help further our mission to positively shift the healthcare industry to one of equal representation.? Equal representation in healthcare has measurable benefits for healthcare professionals and the communities they serve, including increased comfort levels, communication, and trust. When these elements exist, it leads to safer, healthier, and stronger communities as patients are more trusting in their doctors and pursuing preventative care. ?The amount of Black women practicing medicine today is small but very impactful when it comes encouraging the Black community to prioritize their health,? says Dr. Andrea Alexander, MD, FACOG. ?Seeing a doctor who looked like me and the desire to help my community were the main reasons I wanted to go into medicine, but scholarships are what helped ensure I was able to pursue my degree. As an HBCU alumnus working with Tampax and UNCF, it is a full-circle moment that will allow me to help the next generation of Black women in healthcare coming behind me and leave a long-lasting impact on the industry.? Each year?s Flow it Forward Scholarship funds will be awarded through a nomination process for rising juniors and seniors within the Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA) Medical School Prep Program and other HBCU healthcare programs in the UNCF network. So far in this year?s application cycle, Tampax is proud to announce there are 9 Tampax XULA Carmichael Scholars, and more scholarship recipients to come. Addressing the disparities in health care and period education will take time. But, Tampax is dedicated to supporting various organizations and individuals, in addition to UNCF and the scholarship recipients, to continue to help flow change forward in a meaningful way.

This year, the festival will debut eight original films from Black creatives and filmmakers. These films are the latest demonstration of P&G?s commitment to Widen the Screen, intended to improve the portrayal of Black life on screen and expand inclusion efforts for Black creators behind the camera in order to challenge expectations and remove limiting stereotypes. The debut of 8:46 Films Premiering at Tribeca Festival on Friday June 18th, 8:46 Films is a collaboration with SATURDAY MORNING, a collective of Black creative executives, Tribeca Studios and Procter & Gamble. The four films are influenced by the length of time it took for George Floyd?s life to change the world. Filmmakers Zoey Martinson, Camrus Johnson, Gibrey Allen and Marshall Tyler were inspired to take 8 minutes and 46 seconds to tell stories of joy, love, and resilience, fuel the creativity that has always upheld the Black community in the darkest times, and build a legacy of hope. The return of Queen Collective Queen Collective, P&G?s signature multicultural talent development initiative in partnership with Queen Latifah, Flavor Unit Entertainment, and Tribeca Studios, continues to accelerate gender and racial equality behind the camera, by opening doors to the next generation of up-and-coming Black women directors, as it returns to the Tribeca Festival for a third year. The mentoring and talent development program is designed to give women filmmakers of color a platform to share important stories from their unique perspective with the aim of expanding the creative pipeline for Black female creators. Created by four diverse young female directors including Arielle Knight, Tina Charles, Cai Thomas, Haimy Assefa, and premiering at Tribeca on Thursday June 17th, these unique documentaries shine a light on important issues directly impacting the black community such as health care, bias and discrimination. ?Less than 6 percent of writers, directors and producers of US films are Black and less than 10 percent of commercials and movies are created by women leading to a lack of diversity and accurate representation of Black people and women of color. Through programs like the Queen Collective and 8:46 we are using our convening power to address the need to increase diversity in the creative pipeline,? said Marc Pritchard, P&G Chief Brand Officer. ?For years we have used our voice as a leading advertiser to highlight bias and shine a light on systemic issues of inequality. We will continue using our voice as a force for good and force for growth to provide empathy and action to drive lasting change."" ?BET is committed to moving the racial and gender equity mission forward by shifting perceptions through content, so we couldn?t be more proud to be the home of the Queen Collective films, and to be forging new connections with female filmmakers of color,? said Tavia Pitts, Head of BET HER, Vice President of Ad Sales. ?The future of the media industry is predicated on our ability to minimize the barriers for entry for diverse creatives, and that has never been more important than now.? ?Queen Collective is a crucial program supporting diverse voices in film and empowering women filmmakers of color to tell stories that evoke change and unite and heal communities, whilst 8:46 Films are an opportunity to celebrate positive, uplifting affirmative stories that show the richness and beauty of Black life,? said Paula Weinstein, Tribeca Studio?s Chief Content Officer. ?We are so proud to share the work of these amazing filmmakers as part of Tribeca?s Juneteenth Programming. These powerful stories stand shoulder to shoulder in a fight against discrimination, injustices, and bias--they needed to be told, they needed to be told now and they needed to be told by Black creators. I hope that we all learn, share and grow from them.?

Since nearly half of girls drop out of sports during puberty1, Always is rallying society to #KeepHerPlaying, knowing it is an important way for her to gain the confidence and skills that help her become whoever she wants to be. A recent survey, commissioned by Always and conducted in partnership with One Poll, found the benefits for girls in sports go far beyond the cheers, the wins and the bragging rights. Women who played sports during puberty say doing so helped them build skills that have served them throughout their lives. The results showed that, in addition to physical fitness: 53% credit sports for improving their teamwork skills 66% agree it has a positive impact on academic performance 44% said sports improved their ability to deal with stress And ? 56% of parents say sports is beneficial for their daughter?s mental health However, despite all the value sports participation provides, nearly half of girls will drop out of sports during puberty, mostly because they feel the need to focus on other things (27%), they no longer find it fun (23%), or they don?t feel they are good enough (19%). The survey also found that more than 1 in 4 people agree if you?re not winning at sports, there?s no point to keep playing. Always is highlighting the unexpected ways sports can transform her future in a new video. The content showcases Malala Yousafzai, Paralympian & mentor Scout Bassett and human rights activist, poet & storyteller, Sara Mora, who all credit playing sports during puberty as a key enabler of their success. The video aims to inspire people everywhere to help #KeepHerPlaying so she can be whoever she wants to be. You can watch it here. ?The people in my life know me as an advocate for undocumented immigrants and while that is truly my passion, what they may not know is that sports helped me get to where I am today.? says Sara Mora. ?Volleyball taught me teamwork and perseverance that has been critical to my fight for immigrants' rights. I?m proud to partner with Always to make sure girls everywhere have the opportunity to play because with sports, our strength becomes the torch we light our day to day with.? In addition to the three featured in the new video, the following role models are joining Always as they rally society to help keep girls playing because they too have seen the wide-ranging benefits of sports firsthand: Jessica McDonald ? U.S. Women?s National Soccer Team World Cup Champion, Mother and Equal Pay Advocate Elena Delle Donne ? Two-time WNBA MVP, Olympic Gold Medal Basketball Player, Disability Advocate and Small Business Owner Mariah Duran ? Top U.S. Women Street Skateboarder, Olympic Athlete and Athletes for Good Grant Recipient Kavya Kopparapu ? Founder and CEO of the Girls Computing League, Advocate, Changemaker and Innovator ?Playing sports as a young girl taught me determination, hard work and resilience. Not only was I able to achieve my dream of playing on the U.S. Women?s National Soccer Team, but it?s given me the confidence to support and advocate for others. I credit sports for fueling my success off the field ? first as a mother, and now as an activist for equal pay,? says Jessica McDonald. McDonald?s fight for equal opportunities for girls in sport, present and future, is showcased in the HBOMax documentary, LFG. Girls need support and encouragement to stay in the game. That?s why Always is supporting the YMCA to create nationwide programs and curriculums.

To further rally society to #KeepHerPlaying, they are continuing their partnership with Olympic gold medal gymnast Laurie Hernandez and enlisting social media influencers to share firsthand accounts of how sports have had a positive impact on their lives. Research has shown that nearly half of girls in the U.S. drop out of sports during puberty1 and an engaged support system plays a critical role in ensuring girls feel encouraged to stay in sports2. ?I am grateful for the continuing support from my family and coaches in making my most recent choice to withdraw for the final selection process for the Tokyo Olympics due to my knee injury. Without their encouragement and the perseverance I learned in the gym, it would have been difficult to come to this decision,? says Hernandez. ?I am determined to keep training and excited to continue my partnership with Always and Walmart to encourage girls to stay in sports, so they too, can develop the important skills that will help become whoever they want to be in life.? The survey, conducted by OnePoll and commissioned by Always, found that 66% of women who played sports during puberty credit it for helping them become who they are today and nearly 75% of people believe playing sports during puberty has a positive impact on future career success1. To help provide access and opportunity to puberty-aged girls, Always have awarded a total of $500,000 in financial grants to organizations and schools across the country that provide access, opportunity and encouragement for puberty-aged girls in sports. The organizations and schools were selected in partnership with the Women?s Sports Foundation, a national organization that believes one of the most meaningful ways to make an impact in the world of sports is to foster sustainable change in local communities that benefits current and future generations of female athletes. The #KeepHerPlaying Youth Grants will be used in a variety of ways to create equitable and accessible spaces for girls up to the age of 18, from renovating facilities and upgrading equipment to enhancing accessibility for those with varying abilities and expanding services to reach more girls in the community. ?Tennis is a sport that has high economic barriers to entry and is often perceived to be an upper-class sport,? says Sloane Stephens, the Founder of Sloane Stephens Foundation in Studio City, California. ?Thanks to the #KeepHerPlaying youth grant, we will be able to start eradicating these barriers so that our girls can be exposed to the benefits of a lifelong sport. With support from these funds, our year-round programs will continue to operate without gaps to prevent any vulnerable periods of downtime, and we will be able to construct permanent lighting on court to improve safety and accessibility.? Listed below are the non-profit schools and non-profit organizations who have been selected to receive a portion of the #KeepHerPlaying Youth Grant: Angel City Sports, Los Angeles, CA (Goalball and Para-Rowing) Biltmore Preparatory Academy, Phoenix, AZ (Softball) Boys and Girls Club of Benton County, Bentonville, AR (Volleyball, Basketball and Flag Football) Challenged Athletes Foundation, San Diego, CA (Adaptive Track & Field) First Tee of Northwest Arkansas, Lowell, AR (Golf) Hudson River Community Sailing, New York, NY (Sailing) Memphis Inner City Rugby, Memphis, TN (Rugby) MS 363 Lady Lions, Bronx, NY (Basketball) Sloane Stephens Foundation, Studio City, CA (Tennis) Wendy Hilliard Gymnastics Foundation, New York, NY/Detroit, MI (Gymnastics) To learn more about the girls positively impacted by the grants, visit Walmart.com/Always.

Campaign to Empower and Support Girls and Women Athletes Nationwide,"CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--By age 14, girls drop out of sports 2X the rate of boys,[1] and by age 17, 51% of girls will quit.1 This summer, Secret aims to change this alarming reality through their Just #WatchMe campaign, a series of activations across print, social, digital, and in-person spaces to drive funding, representation and visibility for women?s sports at every age group. Secret recognizes the importance and impact being seen and supported can have on marginalized communities that are oftentimes ignored. It begins by encouraging all of us in society to show up and watch women compete in sports every day from the big stage to our local communities. That?s because by performing the simple act of just watching, we can do our part to collectively improve sports for ALL girls and women to erase the stigmas and inequities that often lead to dropping out. ?We all contribute to the biases women athletes face every day,? said Kate DiCarlo, Senior Director of Communications for Personal Care at Procter & Gamble. ?However, we all possess the ability to take meaningful action to ensure girls stay in the game. By partnering with the Women?s Sports Foundation, Secret continues our investment in girls to ensure the next generation of athletes feel seen, supported, and empowered through our #WatchMe donation. Secret encourages everyone to ask the girls and women in their lives how we can support them, knowing something as simple as showing up to watch her play can change her trajectory in both sports and life.? Secret?s Just #WatchMe campaign is about impacting girls? sports at the grassroots level. As part of Secret?s $1 Million commitment to support gender equality, the brand is pledging $150,000, to girls? sports. In partnership with the Women?s Sports Foundation, the #WatchMe donation will create inclusive and equitable spaces for all girls and women, to further encourage and empower tomorrow?s champions through sport. This partnership helps ensure that the next generation of all girl and women athletes don?t have to sweat feeling supported to play the sports they love. ?The fight for equality is the very cornerstone of the Women?s Sports Foundation. Regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation or ability, all girls and women deserve the opportunity to play, compete and lead,? said Deborah Antoine, WSF CEO. ?We are grateful to Secret for the #WatchMe donation to help create inclusive and equitable spaces for all girls and women, and to further encourage and empower tomorrow?s champions. We firmly believe that humanity wins when everyone is represented and included.? Other Details on the Campaign: Secret launched the Just #WatchMe campaign with the ?Watch Me? TV commercial. Airing throughout the summer, the TV commercial calls on everyone to show up for young girls in Sports. Secret enlisted burgeoning artist, Nicole Salgar, to design murals that appeared in New York City, Atlanta and Philadelphia, to help shine a spotlight on powerful women athletes like Olympic gold medalists Alex Morgan and Ashleigh Johnson, Chiney Ogwumike, eight-time Paralympic medalist Oksana Masters and more who are breaking barriers in sports to help inspire the next generation of champions. Secret unveiled ?Just #WatchMe? bleachers, in the heart of NYC today at Merchants Gate Plaza to give fans from all walks of life a front row seat to support, celebrate, encourage, and watch women athletes compete. Top performing women athletes are often told they don?t get as many viewers as the men. And with only 4% of sports media coverage being dedicated to women2, Secret is filling up the bleachers to get people to watch women sports. A game is temporary, but an athlete?s impact can live forever. Secret created a life-sized statue of a girl athlete playing in front of the bleachers, and whether the bleachers are filled, or empty is up to us. The statue was created as a defiant and powerful piece of art to show solidarity for the girls and women in sports whose voices are being challenged across the country. Both the bleachers and statue are accompanied with a viewing party held in New York City to bring fans together to watch some of the greatest girl and women athletes of our generation. To keep the momentum going, a print ad in The New York Times highlights just how important it is to watch our girl and women athletes and invite fans to the viewing party. Athletes will also be joining the effort, sharing the campaign on their social channels. Secret wants to remind everyone; the future is in our hands. Let?s show up and fill the bleachers and stadiums, let?s watch our girls and women compete, let?s encourage them to become the champions of tomorrow. Just #WatchMe.

Durch ihre Arbeit mit Skate Like A Girl ermutigt sie die nﾃδεつεδづつ､chste Generation von Mﾃδεつεδづつ､dchen, ihre Leidenschaft weiter zu verfolgen. Alice Dearing*, Groﾃδεつεδづつ歟ritannien, Schwimmen: Als erste schwarze Schwimmerin fﾃδεつεδづつｼr das britische Team bei den Olympischen Spielen hat Alice die Barrieren im Schwimmsport, mit denen Farbige konfrontiert sind, selbst erlebt. Sie hat die Dinge selbst in die Hand genommen und ist heute eine fﾃδεつεδづつｼhrende Botschafterin der Black Swimming Association (BSA). Ihr Schwerpunkt liegt auf vermehrter Teilhabe und der Verﾃδεつεδづつ､nderung von Einstellungen, damit mehr Schwarze erkennen, wie wichtig es ist, schwimmen zu lernen. Brian Afanador*, Puerto Rico, Tischtennis: Nachdem der Hurrikan Maria auf Puerto Rico schwere Verwﾃδεつεδづつｼstungen angerichtet hatte, nutzte er seine Plattform als Olympiasportler, um durch vermehrte Aufmerksamkeit seiner Gemeinde zu helfen. In Zusammenarbeit mit #Yonomequito Foundation hat er zum Wiederaufbau von Hﾃδεつεδづつ､usern und zur Versorgung bedﾃδεつεδづつｼrftiger Familien vor Ort mit Lebensmitteln, sauberem Wasser und Katastrophendiensten beigetragen. Erica Sullivan, USA, Schwimmen: Als offen homosexuelle asiatisch-amerikanische Schwimmerin setzt Erica sich fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die intersektionelle Gleichberechtigung im Sport ein. Im Rahmen der Olympischen Spiele Tokio 2020 nutzte sie ihre Pressekonferenz dazu, auf Minderheiten wie die LGBTQ??? aufmerksam zu machen. ?Der Geist der Olympischen Spiele hat die Kraft, uns zu beflﾃδεつεδづつｼgeln und zu vereinen, und diese unglaublichen Athleten haben diesen Geist ﾃδεつεδづつｼber die olympische und paralympische Bewegung hinaus in ihre Gemeinden getragen.

Mit seiner Groﾃδεつεδづつ毟ﾃδεつεδづつｼgigkeit gegenﾃδεつεδづつｼber der Sportlergemeinde vor Ort in Tokio hat Pita ﾃδεつεδづつｼberall die Menschen begeistert. Der dreimalige Olympiateilnehmer, der sich seit 15 Jahren ehrenamtlich fﾃδεつεδづつｼr die psychische Gesundheit von Jugendlichen einsetzt, erkannte ﾃδεつεδづつｶffentlich den immensen Druck an, dem Athleten bei Wettkﾃδεつεδづつ､mpfen auf Spitzenniveau ausgesetzt sind. Er lud die Sportler ein, sich an ihn zu wenden, wenn sie psychologischen Beistand oder einen Rat brauchen. Sein Aufruf zum Handeln fﾃδεつεδづつｼhrte zu Hunderten von Gesprﾃδεつεδづつ､chen mit Athleten, sowohl ﾃδεつεδづつｼber soziale Medien als auch persﾃδεつεδづつｶnlich im Rahmen der Olympischen Spiele Tokio 2020. Angesichts seiner Bemﾃδεつεδづつｼhungen, als Resonanzboden fﾃδεつεδづつｼr Athleten zu fungieren und ihnen als Stimme der Unterstﾃδεつεδづつｼtzung Mut zu machen, erkennt P&G gerne an, dass das Gute, das Pita tut, ihn wirklich groﾃδεつεδづつ歛rtig macht.

This free mobile app is designed to help you track your cycle in less than 30 seconds and improve your holistic well-being. In a first-of-its-kind feature, the Always You period tracker lets users improve the lives of others in a tangible way while investing in their own well-being in partnership with Thrive Global. Nearly 1 in 5 girls in the U.S. have missed school due to lack of period products, according to a 2019 Always Confidence and Puberty Study. Science also shows that giving back can be a powerful form of self-care, and has been connected to lower rates of depression and higher self-reported levels of happiness and well-being. The Always You period tracker will enable more users to give back daily, helping build a country where no girl has to miss out on school because she doesn?t have access to period protection. By simply registering and engaging with the app, users can spark donations of period products to help #EndPeriodPoverty through partners like Feeding America. ?Always has been working to help build girls? confidence for more than 35 years, and we are always looking for ways to do more. Our consumers have been using our online period tracker in our Always website for years, and we are now making it more accessible with our new Always You Mobile App. And like everything we do at Always, we saw an opportunity to continue our social impact by turning this into another way for consumers to contribute to help #EndPeriodPoverty,? said Laura Magon, Senior Director of Procter & Gamble for Global Fem Care Innovations ? maker of Always. ?The pandemic has also spotlighted how women are disproportionally impacted by mental health and wellness concerns. We are thrilled to partner with Thrive Global as we developed more than just a period tracker. Together, we created a wellness platform that provides exclusive Thrive Microsteps to help our consumers improve their overall well-being.? More than ever, people are engaging in conversations about their period and intimate health concerns, with over 11 million monthly online searches related to intimate wellness questions. This past year has been especially difficult for women, as 80 percent reported feeling that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a bigger negative impact on their stress than any other event in their lives, according to a Thrive Sciences nationally representative survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults. In a study conducted by CARE, a non-profit international aid organization, researchers found that while almost nobody is spared from the anxiety, worry and overall emotional fatigue of the pandemic, women are almost three times as likely to report suffering from significant mental health consequences including anxiety and inability to sleep. The Always You period tracker responds to these needs by bringing personalized, science-backed articles, videos and activities to women in every life stage to improve their intimate wellness and holistic health. This will help them understand how their physical, mental and emotional health work together ? in addition to having a simple period tracker on the go. To help users form lasting healthy habits, the Always You period tracker also leverages Thrive Global?s behavior change expertise to bring users exclusive Thrive Microsteps ? small, science-backed actions you can start taking immediately to build habits that significantly improve your life. Users can implement and track their chosen Microsteps daily to reduce stress and boost physical and emotional well-being. ?At Thrive, we?re passionate about creating technology that has an impact on people?s lives, and Always You is a perfect example,? said Arianna Huffington, Founder and CEO of Thrive Global. ?We?re not just giving people a period tracker. We?re supporting them and celebrating them with our whole human approach to well-being, and providing too-small-to-fail Microsteps they can take immediately to improve their wellness and build confidence. And we?re especially excited to be doing it to help #EndPeriodPoverty, because giving is one of the most effective and proven ways to boost our well-being, transforming the giver as much as the recipient.? The Always You period tracker was created in collaboration with notable women in the well-being space including writer, poet, and mental health advocate Aija Mayrock, OB-GYN Dr. Kameelah Phillips, TV host, author, and bridal expert Lori Allen, psychologist Dr. Lauren Hazzouri and her 18-year-old daughter, education equality activist Ava Hazzouri, and medical student and health influencer Brooklynne Palmer.

Met de podcast, gepresenteerd door de Britse tv-presentatrice en pleitbezorgster voor mensen met een handicap, Sophie Morgan, worden percepties ter discussie gesteld, successen gevierd en onderzocht hoe de wereld kan worden veranderd voor mensen met en zonder handicap. Sophie zal met enkele van de meest ingevoerde en beroemde professionals, influencers en activisten spreken over belangrijke thema's als handicaps en inclusie. 'Equal Too' is een speciale zesdelige serie die te horen is op de podcast Seneca's Conversations on Power and Purpose en wordt aangeboden door het Seneca Women Podcast Network en iHeart Radio. De serie loopt in augustus en september en gaat in op onderwerpen die tot nadenken stemmen, zoals: Het erfgoed van de Paralympische Beweging en de blijvende impact die het organiseren van de Paralympische Spelen heeft gehad op gaststeden en daarbuiten Hoe de wetgeving voor mensen met een handicap verandert en wat er nog meer moet gebeuren Het traject naar tewerkstelling voor mensen met een handicap, 70 jaar nadat Sir Ludwig Guttmann sport begon te gebruiken om ruimte te creﾃδεつεδづつｫren in de samenleving voor mensen met een handicap Voor 'Equal Too' laat het getalenteerde team achter de bekroonde Netflix-documentaire Rising Phoenix een grote verscheidenheid aan stemmen horen van beleidsmakers, activisten, atleten en bondgenoten van over de hele wereld, waaronder: Jameela Jamil, actrice, presentatrice, erkend pleitbezorger voor gehandicaptenrechten, LGBTQ?? en lichaamsneutraliteit en erkend voor haar werk als oprichtster van de I Weigh Community RJ Mitte, een Amerikaanse acteur, pleitbezorger en filantroop die zich wereldwijd heeft ingezet om te spreken over zijn ervaringen met hersenverlamming in de hoop het stigma dat met handicaps gepaard gaat weg te nemen Tatyana McFadden, een Russisch-Amerikaanse atlete met 17 Paralympische medailles, wiens inspanningen om te pleiten voor gelijkheid van mensen met een handicap hebben geleid tot de goedkeuring van verschillende wetten om studenten met een handicap gelijke toegang te geven tot atletiek Andrew Parsons, een Braziliaanse sportbeheerder en de voorzitter van het Internationaal Paralympisch Comitﾃδεつεδづつｩ (IPC). Het IPC en de International Disability Alliance leidden onlangs de lancering van de #WeThe15-campagne, een wereldwijde beweging ter vertegenwoordiging van de 1,2 miljard mensen met een handicap in de wereld ""'Equal Too,' dat zoveel krachtige en invloedrijke stemmen bijeenbrengt, zal ons helpen om erachter te komen hoe het nu verder moet met het Rising Phoenix-verhaal,"" aldus Greg Nugent, mede-oprichter van Harder Than You Think en de maker van Rising Phoenix. ""De verschillende gesprekslijnen zijn buitengewoon en belangrijk, en de noodzaak om het verhaal te vertellen is meer dan ooit van vitaal belang."" Nu de wereld kijkt naar de ongelooflijke atleten die deelnemen aan de Paralympische Spelen, en geﾃδεつεδづつｯnspireerd door de recente lancering van het #WeThe15-initiatief van het IPC, de grootste beweging in zijn soort voor de gelijkheid van gehandicapten, zegt P&G een donatie toe van $ 100.000 aan de Agitos Foundation. Dit zal een stimulans zijn voor het werk van het IPC om de perceptie van jongeren ten aanzien van mensen met een handicap te veranderen. ""Wij zijn van mening dat grotere zichtbaarheid een cruciale stap is in het veranderen van percepties op het traject naar gelijkheid van mensen met een handicap,"" stelde Phil Duncan, Chief Design Officer en Olympic Games Executive van P&G. ""We hebben allemaal nog veel te leren, daarom willen wij de enorm belangrijke gesprekken in 'Equal Too' graag in de schijnwerpers te zetten. We zijn ook trots om een geldelijke donatie te doen aan de Agitos Foundation, die ongelooflijk impactvol werk doet bij het stimuleren van langdurig bewustzijn voor de volgende generatie.? Omdat zinvolle gesprekken over inclusiviteit alleen mogelijk zijn als ieders stem gelijk vertegenwoordigd is, wordt 'Equal Too' mogelijk gemaakt door een team - van producenten tot gasten en iedereen die een bijdrage levert - dat voor meer dan 60% bestaat uit mensen die zichzelf als gehandicapt beschouwen. Aan het roer van het project staan twee invloedrijke vrouwen: presentatrice en uitvoerend producent Sophie Morgan en uitvoerend producent en verhaaladviseur Sinﾃδεつεδづつｩad Burke. Sophie, die op haar 18e verlamd raakte bij een auto-ongeluk, is een bekroonde omroepster die sinds de Paralympische Spelen in Londen 2012 voor Channel 4 alle Paralympische Spelen heeft gepresenteerd. Zij is een van de eerste en enige vrouwelijke, gehandicapte televisiepresentatoren in de wereld. Sinﾃδεつεδづつｩad, oprichtster van toegankelijkheidsadviesbureau Tilting the Lens, is een kleine vrouw die campagne voert om de basisnormen voor toegankelijkheid te verhogen en zo een wereld op te bouwen die is ontworpen met mensen met een handicap, voor de inclusie van iedereen. Alle afleveringen van de podcast zullen kort na de uitzending worden uitgebracht met downloadbare transcripties. Bovendien zullen ze vergezeld gaan van ondertitelde video's met een dove gebarentolk van de Engelse gebarentaal, Rinkoo Barpaga.

This football season, the two organizations are partnering to educate consumers on the benefits of switching to cold water washing with Tide to not only provide a great clean, but also to help the environment and save money. ?Behavior change on this scale requires significant investment in education and industry collaboration, which is why Tide asked a longstanding partner with a high bar for superior laundry cleaning performance, the NFL, to join our mission to turn to cold water washing,? said Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer at Procter & Gamble. ?When two big brands come together to be a force for good, the potential positive impact is huge. We?re excited to join forces again with the NFL this season and inspire one of America?s largest fan bases to turn to energy-saving cold water cleaning that?s not only good for clothes, it?s better for the planet.? The partnership is the next chapter in Tide?s 2030 Ambition to increase U.S. loads washed in cold to three in four, as a part of its mission to make cold water washing the standard for all Americans. Small Change, Big Impact With a simple turn of the dial, every household that switches to cold will save 90% energy in the wash cycle and up to $150 in energy bills*, while extending the life of their clothes ? a touchdown for every American. Together with the NFL?s reach of 80 million households of NFL fans (over half of U.S. households), the potential cumulative impact of turning to cold is significant. If NFL fans turn to cold, that would result in 16 billion loads of laundry washed on cold per year ? a reduction of 5.6 million metric tons (MT) of GHG emissions and equal to removing more than one million cars from the road for a year. ?We value our longstanding partnership with Tide and are impressed with their creativity and inspiration behind the #TurnToCold program,? said Tim Ellis, Executive Vice President & Chief Marketing Officer for the National Football League. ?After seeing the incredible influence that two big brands can have when they join forces for good, we are excited to collaborate with Tide on this program and further utilize our NFL platform to motivate our passionate fan base to support a small change that can make a massive impact on our environment.? If the NFL Can Trust A Clean on Cold, So Can Consumers With all the sweat, grass and mud stains that come with the game, washing an NFL jersey on cold is also the ultimate stress test to show how Tide not only delivers a superior clean on cold, but saves consumers money and energy at the same time. Tide works better when washing in cold water than the average bargain brand of detergent in hot**. Tide?s newest detergent, Tide Hygienic Clean Heavy Duty 10x, is formulated with 50% more cleaning power*** and a deeper cleaning technology that gets between fibers to effectively remove both visible and invisible dirt. Tide Scientists worked with NFL Team Equipment Managers to optimize formulas and settings, to ensure Tide would meet their high standard. Once they saw the results, they pledged to switch. Starting with 15 teams committed to make the change, the NFL aims to move over 1 million pounds of laundry to cold with Tide per year, while inspiring more teams and fans to join in and make the change. That?s more laundry than a person does in their entire lifetime! Fan Favorite NFL Players Encourage Fans to Turn the Dial To kick off the partnership and rally fans to join the movement, NFL teams and players will advocate for the switch through a series of cold-inspired marketing and consumer activations: Introducing the Tide Cold Washer, the first-ever talking washing machine that reminds consumers to wash in cold. The machines will be released as a limited-edition NFL team branded series and will be customized with fan favorite players? voices from 10 teams. The Washer is designed to turn up the fun and make the cold setting a fan?s favorite wash. Starting on August 31, fans can enter to win one on Tide.com! To celebrate their pledge to turn to cold and rally more fans to join, committed NFL teams will show support in various ways such as taking to social to share their customized washing machines, blue logos, and even turning their stadium lights blue for this season?s games! Atlanta Falcons Quarterback Matt Ryan, aka Matty Ice, will join Tide?s Cold Caller crew alongside ?Stone Cold? Steve Austin and Ice-T in a series of TV spots to share the benefits of turning to cold.

Venus is continuing the brand?s commitment to sustainability by taking steps to help preserve the ocean. Last year, Venus partnered with We Are One Ocean to launch the global organization?s 30X30 initiative, a petition that calls on world leaders to preserve 30 percent of the global ocean by 2030. In addition, Venus has introduced paper packaging and durable, metal razor handles to help make each shave more sustainable. While climate change is a universal issue, a recent report by the United Nations found women globally are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men due to social, economic, and cultural factors.* However, women are not often positioned to help lead effective change. In fact, according to a study conducted by Oceanography Magazine, while men and women enroll in undergraduate and graduate programs in oceanography in equal numbers, only 15% of senior faculty positions across 26 US institutions were held by women.** Now, with the goal of enabling more women to be a part of the solution in protecting the ocean, Venus is forming the brand?s first Board of Trust-Seas. The Board consists of six women who are uniquely breaking barriers in ocean conservation ? from marine biology, to art and photography, to surfing. Carissa Moore, 4X World Surfing Champion, Olympic gold medalist, and ocean lover, will also hold a seat on the newly created Board of dynamic women. ?As a brand that's always been inspired by the ocean, we are incredibly excited to work on this mission together with our Board of Trust-Seas,? said Dana Brown Malcolm, North American Sr. Brand Director of Gillette Venus. ?Each of these women are not only making important strides in the ocean conservation field, but also taking time to mentor young women around them.? WSL Chief People Officer, Emily Hofer, says, ?We?re thrilled to partner with Gillette Venus on the We Are One Ocean campaign, and we are particularly excited about the work that the Board of Trust-Seas is embarking upon. Creating space for women, and others, who are so often marginalized from ocean conservation and sustainability, is crucial work and fully aligned with WSL?s commitment to equality.? The Board?s first assignment kicks off this month with the Venus Wave Makers Program. Each Board member will host unique in-person or virtual experiences with a select number of young women who can benefit from the Board?s mentorship, with the goal of increasing the number of women in ocean conservation fields. In addition to Carissa Moore, the Venus Board of Trust-Seas will include: Symone Barkley (she/her): Chief Learning Officer for Black in Marine Science McKenzie Margarethe: Marine Naturalist and Researcher Katie Storr (she/her): Yachting Professional, Underwater Photographer and Scuba Instructor Carissa Cabrera (she/her): Marine Conservation Biologist and Educator Andriana Fragola (she/her): Marine Biologist and Conservation Jewelry Artist ?This field [ocean conservation] is dominated by men, who can provoke feelings of alienation and doubt in women, so it is imperative that women support each other in the field,? said Symone Barkley, Venus Board of Trust-Seas member. ?I?m excited to partner with Venus to connect with young women about the importance of ocean science and how they can uniquely play a role in leading effective conservation efforts.? To continue the conversation on the topic of women in ocean conservation, on Saturday, September 18, Venus will bring Carissa Moore and the Board of Trust-Seas together for a special panel discussion live from the Super Girl Pro Festival in Oceanside, CA. During the main event on Saturday, Carissa Moore will be competing with other pro female surfers in the water followed by the Board of Trust-Seas panel discussion at 4-5PM PST on the beach. The events will be broadcasted live on their website as well as on Twitch and YouTube, and you can learn more about the Board of Trust-Seas and the discussion happening at SuperGirlPro.com.

OLAY North America is introducing the Easy Open Lid, a limited-edition prototype developed with and for people with disabilities. The Easy Open Lid will be incorporated into the product design of OLAY?s most popular products: the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Vitamin C Peptide 24 Face Moisturizer, Retinol 24 Face Moisturizer and Collagen Peptide 24 Face Moisturizer. To create the design, OLAY met with consumers with a wide range of conditions, from dexterity issues and limb differences, to chronic issues causing joint pain and vision impairments. The team also met with external experts and incorporated personal experiences from team members into the new product design. For more information on this, see HERE. ?Accessibility makes things better for everyone,? says journalist and model Madison Lawson who is living with muscular dystrophy. She is one of the key members with whom OLAY worked closely with to bring this jar to life. ?Everyone?s been there where you get product on your hands or you?re trying to open something and you can?t, so I think it?s cool that this is designed with us specifically in mind but it also makes everyone?s life better.? The Easy Open Lid is designed with: Easy open winged cap Extra grip raised lid High contrast product label Braille text ?face cream? ?We were honored to work closely with a passionate group of people to bring this Easy Open Lid to life,? said Chris Heiert, Senior Vice President of Olay. ?As a global brand, it?s our responsibility to ensure that ALL consumers have access to products that serve their needs and fit seamlessly into their daily lives. But we can?t do it alone, which is why we?ve chosen not to patent this lid, and rather share the design widely with the beauty community. Our hope is that others will join us in our efforts in making products more accessible for everyone.? The lids are available now exclusively on olay.com/opentochange. In addition to sharing the design widely with the beauty industry, OLAY is offering the lid to consumers at no additional cost?it comes free with the purchase of one of the four OLAY Regenerist Moisturizers mentioned above. For hi-res images, see HERE. OLAY remains committed to equality and inclusion, and champions a more diverse and inclusive standard of beauty in which there is not one, but many, representations of what is ?beautiful?. By 2025, P&G, including OLAY, has pledged to make its packaging more accessible for people with disabilities. Olay?s breakthrough Easy Open Lid is just one step toward inclusivity in skin care. OLAY is encouraging all companies to participate and make the beauty industry more inclusive and accessible to all.

With its mission to enable better oral health for all, it is also bringing the revolutionary Oral-B iO? lineup to more people with the addition of iO4 and iO5 brushes, as well as reimagining ?Attack of the Cavity Creeps? as a fun, educational video game. ?Our mission does not end at a smart toothbrush or better brushing coach; it is about developing a larger digital health ecosystem that leads with advanced technologies, accessible solutions and more effective educational tools to improve oral care and health for all,? said Alita Vegas, P&G Global Oral Care Senior Vice President. ?With our latest announcements at CES 2022, we?re building a digital health ecosystem to take on the oral health crisis in America. Oral-B is committed to helping people across the globe access the very best in oral care technology while teaching them about the dangers of tooth decay and encouraging healthy oral care habits.? ?Furthermore, we are expanding the iO line-up to include iO4 and iO5, providing accessibility to more people. In addition, I?m excited to announce the launch of Oral-B iO9 later this year in Latin America, allowing us to reach more global consumers than ever before,? Vegas concluded. ?This game-changing, rechargeable toothbrush brought consumers the ability to have a professional clean feel in just 2 minutes, and received the ADA seal of acceptance, recognized by dentists and consumers as the gold standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of dental products.? Oral-B iO Technology Originally launched in 2020, Oral-B iO was the result of six years of dedicated research with dental professionals to ensure people have the best possible oral health outcomes at home. Oral-B iO strikes the right balance between effectiveness and experience and reimagines how a brush performs. It offers a unique blend of innovative features, such as a linear magnetic drive, bi-modal smart pressure sensor, and redesigned brush head, to deliver the WOW of a professional clean feel at home. In clinical tests, Oral-B iO provided a deeper cleaning of teeth and gums, allowing users to easily and effectively maintain oral health. When compared to manual toothbrushes, Oral-B iO users experienced: 100 percent healthier gums in just one week 6 times more plaque removal along the gumline 3 times greater reduction in bleeding gums 83 percent of gingivitis patients moved from unhealthy to healthy gums in eight weeks 14.5 times higher odds of achieving healthy gums And, when used with the right oral care products such as Crest Gum Detoxify toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, and Oral-B Glide floss, the results are even better with 100% of regimen users resolving their gingivitis and achieving healthy gums in 12 weeks (vs. just 7% of manual users). Introducing Oral-B iO10 with iOSense Built on Oral-B?s award-winning iO technology and a CES 2022 Innovation Awards honoree, the new iO10 with iOSense technology is the ultimate oral health coach. This rechargeable, electric toothbrush offers an intuitive and connected experience that provides real-time insights, setting a new standard in oral care. iO10 provides live coaching directly on the iOSense Charger to guide your time, pressure, and coverage in real-time without needing to take a phone into the bathroom. Plus, it includes a clock and a timer to help you brush for the dentist-recommend two minutes. User brushing data syncs to the Oral-B app for greater insights into brushing habits. With seven different cleaning modes, you can personalize your brushing for the WOW of a professional clean feeling at home. Join the iO10 VIP waitlist now and you?ll be one of the first notified when the brush is available for purchase: https://oralb.com/en-us/join-oralb-iO10-waitlist. Greater Accessibility with Oral-B iO4 and iO5 Featuring the same groundbreaking iO technology, the iO4 and iO5 enable more people to get better oral health results at home by improving brushing habits and providing a powerful clean. Each brush features multiple brushing modes to personalize your cleaning experience, with rainbow celebration lights upon the completion of brushing for two minutes and refill LED reminders directly on the handles. The iO5 can also provide users with real-time coverage tracking and coaching via the Oral-B app. The iO4 and iO5 will be available nationwide beginning in 2022. Priced for less than $100 USD, both brushes will be offered in a range of colors including quite white, matte black, blush pink, icy blue and lavender. Greater Access to Professional Dental Care Oral-B is partnering with Grin, a leading teledentistry platform, that allows consumers to capture high-res images of their mouth on their smartphone, and securely transmit dental scans to their provider for an at-home consultation. Together, Oral-B and Grin hope to transform at-home oral health by giving consumers access to personalized oral health insights and at-home professional consultations. The field of orthodontics is a great example: For many consumers, teeth straightening under the care of a local orthodontist is inaccessible?either due to distance from an office or the time commitment. The Grin platform consists of a scope that affixes to any smartphone and allows orthodontists to transition patient check-ins from in-office to remote, including monitoring teeth movement, gum health, and oral hygiene. With the Oral-B and Grin partnership, now orthodontists can virtually recommend the oral care products and behaviors their patients need to maintain good oral health treatment. This is especially important for kids, where early identification and remediation of poor oral hygiene can prevent longer treatment duration and extra office visits. Oral-B and Grin believe that when consumers have a superior understanding of their oral health, they can take action early by selecting the right products, modifying behavior, and having more frequent, informed conversations with their dentist. Over the coming months, Oral-B and Grin will begin to reveal innovation that empowers consumers and their families to take greater control of their oral health at home. You can find more information on Grin at get-grin.com. Attack of the Cavity Creeps Oral care education is a crucial part of overall health, and children are particularly susceptible to tooth decay. In fact, having cavities at an early age makes you four times more likely to have dental issues as an adult. Knowing this, Oral-B and Crest have developed an immersive video game ??Attack of the Cavity Creeps? ? based on the fondly remembered ad campaign from the late 70?s and early 80?s that teaches kids better oral health habits. Being displayed at CES for the very first time, players will drop into the middle of Toothopolis and complete missions to combat bad breath, discoloration, early signs of gum disease, enamel erosion and defeat General Decay. ?Attack of the Cavity Creeps? will also be rolled out to kids and families as a part of Crest and Oral-B?s commitment to ?Closing the Smile Gap? through dental care access, education and oral care donations.

With Dawn EZ-Squeeze we wanted to create a dish soap that was designed to be fast and easy, helping you get away from the sink and on with your life.? Dawn devoted more than five years, hundreds of designs, and thousands of hours of testing, in the development of Dawn EZ-Squeeze making it one of P&G?s most researched and rigorously tested products in the Company?s 50 year history within the dish soap category. During this extensive consumer testing, Dawn found that the package?s unique valve design not only delivered a mess-free experience, but the lack of a cap improved ease of use for populations who had challenges with existing bottle designs since it could be dispensed easily with one hand. Easy to use packaging has quickly become one of the most valued characteristics for home care brands1. Dawn EZ-Squeeze's one-handed design allows people to easily apply the intended amount of soap directly to dishes with greater control, so that Dawn?s grease-fighting formula can begin working immediately. The EZ-Squeeze bottle isn?t the product?s only upgrade ? the formula has also been updated to help dissolve both everyday grease and tough, cooked-on messes quickly and easily, allowing people to spend less time and fewer resources at the sink. It effortlessly removes 99% of grease and food residues and, with 4x faster grease-cleaning,** people will get the most value out of every bottle until the very last drop. With Dawn EZ-Squeeze, people no longer have to shake or flip. Simply grab and squeeze. ?We noticed a gap in design innovation when it comes to dish soap bottles, and we were excited to act on it,? said Corey Brugh, Senior Engineer, Research & Development, North America Dish at Procter & Gamble. ?We?re excited about the incredible response Dawn EZ-Squeeze has received already through our initial testing, and can?t wait for more people to try this groundbreaking and efficient way to wash dishes.? A video outlining real people who asked for this innovation and how Dawn answered by flipping dishwashing on its head can be viewed here. Dawn EZ-Squeeze is now available at mass retailers nationwide in Platinum and Original formulas. To learn more about Dawn EZ-Squeeze, visit www.dawn-dish.com. *??Based on Sales.

But that?s about to change. For 40 years conditioners have been saying the same thing ? ?condition and detangle hair?? and consumers were tired of it. So, Pantene surveyed women and asked what they really wanted from their dream conditioner. And turns out, it?d be more like a styler. The new Pantene conditioners are designed to make styling easier, more consistent, and longer lasting, with twice the protective antioxidants and pro-vitamin B5. Can your conditioner do that? To prove these bold claims, Pantene has partnered with a Collective of impressive, strong, modern, multi-hyphenate women known for pushing boundaries who will help demo the conditioners against their everyday activities. The Pantene Conditioner Collective will work to redefine conditioner?s status quo with humor, creativity, and inspiration, demonstrating how hairstyles hold up in real life scenarios when you dare to demand more from your conditioner. The Pantene Conditioner Collective members include: Chloe Fineman, star of Saturday Night Live and Dickinson known for viral impressions and insane personal style Jess King, Peloton instructor who rocks iconic, long red braids and ponytails through powerful workouts Meg Stalter, breakout sketch comedian and actress on HBO?s Hacks who captivates with her honest, audacious humor Nardia Boodoo, model and ballerina with The Washington Ballet whose Indo-Trinidadian heritage radiates through her natural curls Ezinma, violinist, composer and educator shattering the stereotypes of classical music, performing with top pop artists and working on her own debut album, Classical Bae The Collective makes their debut in Pantene?s new film ?Can Your Conditioner Do This?,? a vibrant showcase of ways conditioner can deliver more for your changing hairstyles. It features the women wearing updos that undo to soft curls, braids that last for miles, hairstyles that hold with less breakage and loose waves that last even under hot stage lights. ?These women are the main characters in their own lives, and we?re inspired by their use of style as a means of expressing individuality and the different aspects of themselves,? said Maris Croswell, Senior Brand Director at Pantene. ?At Pantene, our goal is to create products that help her achieve her desired end look so she can express herself freely, and her hair needs a strong, healthy foundation to do that. Our new formulas have 2X the active nutrients* and nourish hair to make it easier to style. She can experiment with her styles and express her individuality, knowing her hair can keep up with everything she asks of it.? Later this year, Chloe will be kicking off a series of #PanteneCanDoThat challenges on Instagram. Through these challenges, Collective members will showcase how using Pantene conditioner enhances their style. From recreating popular hairstyles, to bringing back the 2000?s, our Collective will share how Pantene helps achieve and maximize their hairstyles. Fans can add their content as well using #PanteneCanDoThat. ?It?s 2022 - You should be asking more from your conditioner!? said Fineman. ?I love having a conditioner that can keep up with my day ? constantly changing styles, getting into different characters - I know my Pantene conditioner can keep up with whatever I throw at my hair.? Additionally, all of the beautiful imagery supporting the launch of Pantene?s new conditioners showcases the authentic beauty and individuality of the Conditioner Collective members. The imagery undergoes no digital alterations that would change the original texture, color, style, and overall individuality we strive to celebrate. These images showcase strong, healthy, unique and beautiful hair? in its best and truest light. Moving forward, all of Pantene?s beauty imagery will genuinely showcase real, diverse, natural beauty and its many different forms. Pantene?s new conditioners include five varieties (Daily Moisture Renewal, Curl Perfection, Smooth & Sleek, Repair & Protect and Volume & Body), and will be available for $4.99 nationwide at drugstores, food stores and mass merchandisers January 2022. *Antioxidant nutrients, vs. 2021 base Pantene formula",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220124005107/en/Chloe-Fineman-Leads-Pantene%E2%80%99s-New-Conditioner-Collective,businesswire.com,5,cincinnatibusiness wireconditioner long considered shampoo obligatory sidekick thats change year conditioner saying thing condition detangle hair consumer tired pantene surveyed woman asked really wanted dream conditioner turn itd like styler new pantene conditioner designed make styling easier consistent longer lasting twice protective antioxidant provitamin b conditioner prove bold claim pantene partnered collective impressive strong modern multihyphenate woman known pushing boundary help demo conditioner everyday activity pantene conditioner collective work redefine conditioner status quo humor creativity inspiration demonstrating hairstyle hold real life scenario dare demand conditioner pantene conditioner collective member include chloe fineman star saturday night live dickinson known viral impression insane personal style jess king peloton instructor rock iconic long red braid ponytail powerful workout meg stalter breakout sketch comedian actress hbos hack captivates honest audacious humor nardia boodoo model ballerina washington ballet whose indotrinidadian heritage radiates natural curl ezinma violinist composer educator shattering stereotype classical music performing top pop artist working debut album classical bae collective make debut pantenes new film conditioner vibrant showcase way conditioner deliver changing hairstyle feature woman wearing updos undo soft curl braid last mile hairstyle hold less breakage loose wave last even hot stage light woman main character life inspired use style mean expressing individuality different aspect said mari croswell senior brand director pantene pantene goal create product help achieve desired end look express freely hair need strong healthy foundation new formula x active nutrient nourish hair make easier style experiment style express individuality knowing hair keep everything asks later year chloe kicking series pantenecandothat challenge instagram challenge collective member showcase using pantene conditioner enhances style recreating popular hairstyle bringing back collective share pantene help achieve maximize hairstyle fan add content well using pantenecandothat asking conditioner said fineman love conditioner keep day constantly changing style getting different character know pantene conditioner keep whatever throw hair additionally beautiful imagery supporting launch pantenes new conditioner showcase authentic beauty individuality conditioner collective member imagery undergoes digital alteration would change original texture color style overall individuality strive celebrate image showcase strong healthy unique beautiful hair best truest light moving forward pantenes beauty imagery genuinely showcase real diverse natural beauty many different form pantenes new conditioner include five variety daily moisture renewal curl perfection smooth sleek repair protect volume body available nationwide drugstore food store mass merchandiser january antioxidant nutrient v base pantene formula,0.999,0.4995,0.1665,0.333,Positive Impact

Darﾃδεつεδづつｼber hinaus werden beim Gillette Cup Mitglieder der Gillette Gaming Alliance in den Gillette Bed Battles, einer in Fortnite Creative erstellten Karte, neben Mitgliedern der weltweiten Fortnite-Community antreten.

Gillette, ein Pionier fﾃδεつεδづつｼr Nicht-Gaming-Marken in der E-Sport-Branche, hat im November 2021 die speziell entwickelte Gilette Bed Battles-Karte vorgestellt. Schon in den ersten zwei Wochen wurde die Karte ﾃδεつεδづつｼber 250.000 Mal gespielt und hat sich damit als eine der am stﾃδεつεδづつ､rksten wachsenden Kampfkarten im Fortnite-Kreativmodus etabliert. Mitglieder der Gillette Gaming Alliance rund um den Globus gehﾃδεつεδづつｶrten zu den ersten, die das Spiel genieﾃδεつεδづつ歹n und spielen konnten, unter ihnen Dr. Lupo (Nordamerika), Elded (Mexiko), Jolavanille (Frankreich), Juansguarnizo (Mexiko) und Ocastrin (Brasilien).

Alle Teams spielen drei Runden Bed Battles nach einem Ranglisten-Punktesystem, wobei die beiden besten Teams aus jeder Region ins Halbfinale einziehen. Am zweiten Tag finden das Halbfinale und das Finale statt, bei denen die 12 aufsteigenden Teams in zwei Sechser-Gruppen aufgeteilt werden und eine Runde spielen. Die drei besten Duos aus jeder Gruppe (also insgesamt sechs Duos) ziehen in das Finale ein, das in drei Runden ausgetragen wird. Das letzte verbliebene Duo wird zum Gillette-Cup-Sieger gekﾃδεつεδづつｼrt und teilt sich ein Preisgeld von 25.000 Dollar.

While internships are essential to breaking into professional industries and gaining practical experience, unpaid or low-wage internships create a financial burden impacting future success and growth, especially in young communities of color. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers? (NACE) 2019 Student Survey1, 6% of Black students and fewer than 8% of Latinx students had a paid internship experience. Students from low-income backgrounds were more likely to work jobs or internships that limit their long-term career goals, prevent expansion of their professional networks, and impact their overall performance.2 NOU is a newly launched hair care brand created for the unique textures, porosities, and styles of curly- and coily-haired Gen Zers. Committed to creating access and opportunities for the next generation of changemakers, NOU worked closely with Pay Our Interns to identify challenges associated with career advancement, most significantly experienced by BIPOC and working-class students and interns. The ?Next of Us Intern Opportunity Fund? was created to help students jumpstart their careers by offsetting financial needs associated with unpaid internships. The ?Next of Us Intern Opportunity Fund? will award $50,000 in need-based stipends to college students to cover living and educational expenses including food, housing, transportation, or family care/contribution. Between February 16 and March 31, 2022, students can apply for a grant at https://payourinterns.org/nou-internship-opportunity-fund. ?NOU believes in the power of the next generation to make the world better for themselves and generations to come,? said Lela Coffey, Vice President, Multicultural Hair Brands and North America Hair Care Portfolio, P&G Beauty. ?We are proud to partner with Pay Our Interns to establish a program that tangibly serves the unique needs of Gen Z communities of color, helping to make their hair and life journey a more fulfilling experience.? Pay Our Interns works to achieve equitable career path access for all students by identifying gaps and establishing benchmarks; shifting perceptions and spotlighting the growing role of internships in today?s economy; and activating stakeholders to take action toward ending unpaid internships. The organization aims to develop pathways for advancement, with the objective of creating a more equitable workforce, more diverse leadership across all sectors, and a more just world. ?We?re thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with Next of Us on the Intern Opportunity Fund,? said Carlos Mark Vera, Executive Director of Pay Our Interns. ?NOU?s mission to support Gen Z and ensure equity and representation in hair care aligns closely with our ongoing work to increase diversity in our overall workforce. The idea that we can all strive to be our best when we have the tools to do so, is something both POI and NOU believe in strongly, and something we believe this fund will help our applicants do.?

Today, Crest ? the #1 Toothpaste brand in America ? is launching its biggest innovation in years, a premium toothpaste that actively rebuilds tooth density by re-mineralizing enamel: Crest Densify. Fewer than 1 in 5 millennials rank density and enamel protection as the top benefit they look for when selecting a toothpaste, but more than half are worried about losing their teeth as they age ? ahead of going gray, getting wrinkles, or even gaining weight.* That is why Crest is looking to help people invest in the wellness of their teeth, which starts with the right toothpaste and routine. Crest Densify uses a new premium formula to offer a trusted defense against early tooth decay and features the same trusted active ingredient in many other Crest products, stannous fluoride. How it works: Strengthens Teeth: Re-hardens enamel (remineralization) for strong healthy teeth Protects Teeth: Prevents future decay (demineralization) by creating 24-hour density protection against density loss, with twice a day brushing. ?Most people don?t realize how important maintaining the density of your teeth is in relation to the longevity of your smile,? said Carlos Quintero, Vice President of Oral Care North America, Procter & Gamble. ?Crest Densify toothpaste extends the life of your teeth by actively rebuilding tooth density every time you brush. With this new launch, we want to encourage people to prioritize the wellness of their teeth every day and strengthen their smile for years to come.?

These are the realities Black moms are confronted with during their pregnancy journey. America?s maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the developed world and highest among Black women1. In fact, Black mothers are 3x more likely to die or suffer complications in pregnancy and post-partum than white women, and 60% of all maternal deaths are preventable 2. Pampers believes the time to change the outcomes for Black moms is now; which is why the brand is proud to sponsor the fifth annual Black Maternal Health Week, founded and led by Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), and partner with Rock The Bells to create a limited edition Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection with proceeds going back to BMMA to advance care for more Black mamas. ?It can be assumed that pregnancy is a time of excitement and joy for all parents, but when we look at the harsh reality of the experience for Black moms we understand that is not the full story. Pregnancy and birth can be scary, even more so when you?re three times more likely not to survive it,? said Melissa Aceves, Senior Brand Director of Pampers Equity & Inclusion at Procter & Gamble. ?At Pampers, we believe every parent is entitled to experience the full joy of pregnancy and parenthood. That?s why we are committed to helping change the systemic issues that prevent Black moms from receiving the equitable care they and their families deserve. We?re proud to sponsor Black Maternal Health Week and provide a way for people to help drive change through our NFT offering.? This Black Maternal Health Week, Pampers will help further BMMA?s work centered on providing Black women scholarships, maternity care and advocacy. The limited edition NFT is designed by artist Keah Adams of Art By Venus Studio - an advocate for Black voices in the Arts ? and will be auctioned on Thursday, April 14th on Curio, the premier NFT platform for some of the biggest names in entertainment. Proceeds will support BMMA, a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating, changing policy and shifting culture for Black maternal health, rights and justice. ?We appreciate the support and amplification of our Black Maternal Health Week campaign by Pampers,? said Angela D. Aina, executive director at Black Mamas Matter Alliance. ?Similar efforts by likeminded brands allows for broader reach of the necessary awareness of the maternal mortality crisis in the United States, and showcases ways that this problem can be addressed through supporting Black-led maternal health equity initiatives.? The NFT collection will feature a unique motion-designed NFT starting at a reserve price of $6,000 USD, inclusive of 2 VIP tickets to the upcoming Rock The Bells Festival on August 6th, in New York City; as well as an unlimited number of open edition digital collectible NFTs for $60 USD, like purchasing a digital print. For the first 24 hours after the auction is live, Rock The Bells and Curio will match all sales up to $10,000 on the open edition NFT. ?Working to reduce Black maternal mortality is a cause that we could not be more proud to support,? said James Cuthbert, president of Rock The Bells, the global lifestyle brand and preeminent voice for classic and timeless Hip-Hop founded by LL COOL J. ?This partnership signifies the imperative action needed to support Black mothers and we?re excited to join Pampers? deep work in this space with Curio?s innovative technology to help fight for better outcomes for Black mothers.? The Black Maternal Health Week sponsorship and NFT auction builds on Pampers? track record of taking action to address maternal health disparity. In 2021, the brand invested over $1 million in educational resources to enable equitable care for parents before, during and after birth; helped provide implicit bias training for healthcare professionals in partnership with March of Dimes; curated resources to help parents prepare for the journey and connect with specialized care resources; and partnered with Queen Collective and director Haimy Assefa, to produce a documentary on the realities of giving birth as a Black person in America. In 2022 and beyond, Pampers is expanding the implicit bias training with March of Dimes, which will positively impact over 20,000 parents each year; and forming ongoing strategic partnerships with other leading organizations in the field. All with the goal of helping to lower the systemic barriers Black moms face in receiving equitable care.

Washing in cold saves up to 90% of the energy in every wash cycle1 and can save Americans up to $150 a year. Put another way, switching one load from hot to cold saves enough electricity to power the average American home for over an hour2. To raise awareness of the next impactful, energy-saving eco-habit and drive adoption of cold water wash at scale, Tide and WWF will conduct new research to better understand behavioral tipping points, including the significance of cues at the point of action in the laundry room. The goal is to use this new research to inform increasingly impactful behavior change campaigns in the race against the clock to limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees by 2030. The Big Benefits of a Simple Switch Consumer behavior, when accompanied by infrastructure, political, and manufacturing changes has the potential to make a meaningful impact toward climate change. The potential environmental impact of Americans turning to cold water is so significant that, last year, Tide set a goal to turn 3 in 4 laundry loads to cold by 2030 as part of a series of overarching environmental ambitions. Tide estimates that a decade of Americans washing the majority (3 in 4) of their loads in cold would save enough electricity to power all of New York City and San Francisco for over a year3. That?s the equivalent of 27 million metric tons (MT) of GHG emissions4 or nearly ten times that of P&G?s global yearly operations5. Currently, more than half of laundry loads are done using cold water. This puts Tide roughly a quarter of the way to its 2030 cold water ambition in the first year, thanks in large part to multiple, broad-reaching brand marketing campaigns touting the benefits of cold water in the last twelve months. ?Advancing cold water adoption is our single greatest opportunity as a brand to drive positive impact for our planet, given that over two-thirds of the impact of laundry comes from the energy required to heat water in the wash cycle,? said Martin Hettich, SVP, North American Fabric Care at Procter & Gamble. ?We?re very encouraged by the adoption we?ve seen thus far, but we also recognize that the urgency of climate change requires us to do more, faster. Thanks to years of research and development, washing on cold with Tide helps the planet, saves energy and saves money, while still delivering the same great clean. We believe the more consumers experience these benefits, the more likely they are to make a permanent switch to cold.? As America?s most trusted laundry detergent, Tide has led the charge to switch to cold water washing for more than 20 years with breakthrough innovations like enzymes specifically optimized for performance in lower wash temperatures. Efforts to drive cold water adoption were advanced by the announcement of Tide?s 2030 Ambition last March, a set of broad-reaching sustainability commitments to decarbonize laundry and reduce GHG emissions across the entire laundry lifecycle, including a goal to cut GHG emissions by half in Tide?s manufacturing operations. Working to Speed Behavior Change The urgency of climate change requires us all to continually adopt new, individual habits that, taken together again and again over time, have considerable positive impact for the planet. Consumers want to do their part to live more sustainably at home (72%, according to P&G survey6) but don?t always know where to start. According to a survey by Tide and WWF, turning off the lights is broadly recognized by Americans as an important eco-habit (83%) with 6 out of 7 Americans saying they consciously make an effort to turn off the lights when not in use. Turning the dial to cold is an equally simple action with significant savings, but fewer than 0.5% of Americans list it as a home energy-saving eco-habit that comes to mind7. ?We have seen how the accumulation of small acts can lead to big impact. With the window for reaching our climate goals rapidly closing, it is imperative that we demonstrate in big and small ways our commitment to protect our planet for today?s inhabitants and future generations,? said Sheila Bonini, senior vice president, private sector engagement, WWF. ?WWF?s collaboration with Tide will explore ways to drive more sustainable consumer behavior and build a stronger commitment to climate action overall. The climate crisis is already affecting all of us, and we don?t have time to lose.? Tide and WWF are collaborating on new research to uncover insights on behavioral tipping points -- specifically, the importance of physical cues at the point of consumer action in the laundry room. The research project will build on existing studies Tide has conducted that show that when consumers hear about the numerous benefits of cleaning in cold, they convert. For example, while nearly 70 percent of people still use either warm/or hot water to some degree when washing, over 60 percent would wash on cold if they knew it could help the environment. Moreover, when consumers do try washing in cold, they are likely to keep the habit, citing brighter whites and colors, better clothing longevity and a sense of personal accomplishment knowing they have made an environmentally friendly choice8.

For every pet Bounty helps get adopted, Best Friends will have the ability to save two more. ?By partnering with Best Friends Animal Society, we?re able to help save the lives of these loveable mess-makers and get them into their fur-ever home,? says Janette Yauch, Vice President, Bounty. ?With Bounty, we also get to help these new parents when it comes to quickly picking up any pet mess once they get home.? Joining Bounty?s efforts in surprising these new pet owners is Katherine Schwarzenegger ? New York Times bestselling author, mother, wife, daughter, advocate and dog mom to rescue pup Maverick. Going from fostering Maverick to providing him with his forever home is what inspired her to write her first children?s book, Maverick and Me. Schwarzenegger is also an ambassador for Best Friends Animal Society. ?Adopting Maverick and being introduced to the animal rescue rower has been one of the joys of my life,? says Katherine. ?So, when Bounty asked me to partner with them to help rescue pets at Best Friends, I knew I had to say yes.? Every year 347,000 pets are killed in shelters across the U.S., according to Best Friends Animal Society. Currently, there are 100,000 more pets at-risk of being killed in shelters than at this time last year due to recent problems such as staffing shortages, limited shelter hours, decreased volunteers, and reduced adoption events. For every pet Bounty helps get adopted, it can save two lives: the pet who goes home and the one who now has space to come to a Best Friends Lifesaving Center. ""May is one of the highest intake months for animal shelters around the country. The sad truth is that shelters get overcrowded when pets aren?t adopted quickly enough and this can put lives at risk,"" says Castle. ""That?s why we?re grateful that Bounty wanted to quickly come to the rescue and pick up adoption fees this month. It'll help Best Friends get more pets into homes at this critically needed time.""

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has registered Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner (EPA Reg No. 4091-21-3573) to keep killing 99.9% of bacteria & viruses that cause the flu and COVID-19, for up to 24 hours, even when the surface is touched or contacted multiple times1. While it had previously been registered by the EPA to provide an initial kill of viruses, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner has been tested by a third-party lab, in accordance with the EPA testing guidelines, and was shown to provide up to 24-hour residual antiviral defense. The EPA has conducted a data review and granted registration. In addition to killing viruses for up to 24 hours, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner also provides a defensive shield that keeps killing bacteria for up to 24 hours2, making it the first consumer product registered to keep killing 99.9% of bacteria and viruses for up to 24 hours, even after multiple touches. ?Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner is a brand that has dedicated years to research in order to create meaningful science-backed products that bring consumers a sense of confidence they?re doing what they can to defend their home and surfaces in this ever-changing world,? said Marchoe Northern, Senior VP North America Home Care, P&G. ?Since launch, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner has provided people with a 24-hour bacteria shield, and we continue to look for ways to deliver long-lasting defense. We?re excited to bring consumers a product that combines Microban 24?s cleaning power with 24-hour residual defense against bacteria and viruses, touch after touch.? What many people may not realize is that even after sanitizing a surface, bacteria and viruses can be reintroduced to the surface and spread from surface to surface through the human touch. Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner can help people defend their surfaces from bacteria and viruses for a full day, even after repeated touches. To kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses for up to 24 hours on hard, non-porous, non-food contact surfaces, consumers can simply preclean visibly dirty surfaces and then spray Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner until thoroughly wet and allow to air dry without wiping. ?It remains extremely important to sanitize against both bacteria and viruses. Having a tool that will keep killing both for up to 24 hours will allow people to defend their households against these microbes,? said Dr. Frank Esper, an expert in respiratory viruses & emerging infectious diseases and an advisor to Microban 24. ?As people continue to take preventative measures to reduce the spread of bacteria and viruses that can cause illnesses, the ability to use a 3-in-1 product that cleans, sanitizes and defends against 99.9% of bacteria and viruses for up to 24 hours is a game-changer.? Prior to this approval, Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner was registered by the EPA to initially kill viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, in just 60 seconds and was included on EPA List N. Microban 24 Multi-Purpose Cleaner is available in both Fresh Scent and Citrus Scent. The entire Microban 24 product lineup is sold at major retailers nationwide in store and online.

Always will be raising money for Uniquely You Summit, an organization focused on empowering Black girls and helping them garner self-love, self-worth and self-care. In addition, fans can support the cause by going to https://www.pggoodeveryday.com/signup/gen-G-give-away/ to redeem points to provide a charitable donation. ?Tampax and Always, leaders in the period care category, are committed to driving confidence while breaking down period stigma through real-talk education and open and honest conversations,? said Melissa Suk, Vice President, North America Tampax and Always, Procter & Gamble. ?Through programs like Always? #KeepHerPlaying campaign, we?ve seen firsthand the importance of encouraging girls to participate in sports to help build confidence. We?re proud to expand this work into esports by partnering with Gen.G and Galorants, two like-minded organizations who champion the same mission of breaking down barriers in the gaming community, to continue to deliver on our mission.?

Collaboration to Conquer the Meat Sweats With a Limited-Edition Meat Sweat Defense Kit Drop,"CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Old Spice and Arby?s have joined forces to tackle the meat sweats with the long-lasting sweat protection of Old Spice Sweat Defense Dry Spray. No longer will you live in fear of that treacherous moment halfway through a delicious Arby?s Half Pound Roast Beef Sandwich when the dreaded meat sweats strike with a vengeance. To defeat it once and for all, you need the limited-edition Meat Sweat Defense kit now available at Arbysshop.com/products/meat-sweat-defense-kit. The key defense against the meat sweats is?drumroll please?the Old Spice Sweat Defense Dry Spray with its 24/7 sweat and odor protection! Each Meat Sweat Defense Kit is equipped with two dry sprays in popular scents that protect guys from the meat sweating potential of the Half Pound Roast Beef Sandwich. But that?s not all! Alongside the dry spray will be a one-of-a-kind viral-worthy roast beef-patterned Meat Sweat sweatshirt and sweatpant with a co-branded towel and headband. For those who can?t get their hands on the limited-edition kits, Old Spice and Arby?s legendary commercial creative minds came together to create an iconic new advertising spot featuring the Old Spice Guy, Isaiah Mustafa, and the iconic Arby?s Voice. The spot was directed by Ruganzu ?Riggs? Howard and produced by Wieden?? and Fallon. Fans everywhere will be able to check it out on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. ?Ultimeat Dreams? - For the ulti-meat crossover, the legendary Old Spice Guy Isaiah Mustafa crashes an Arby?s commercial heroically scaling the side of an Arby?s Half Pound Roast Beef Sandwich by interrupting Ving Rhames, the Arby?s Voice, in an attempt to spread the word about Old Spice Meat Sweat Defense. After getting caught climbing the epic roast beef sandwich, the Old Spice Guy falls onto a horse?y sauce to defend the meats, not the sweats. ?A collaboration between Old Spice and Arby?s to solve the age-old problem of the notorious meat sweats that we?ve all faced at some point was a perfect match,? said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice vice president at Procter & Gamble. ?Old Spice continues to look for ways to leverage signature humor and unexpected partnerships that remind them of the importance of long-lasting protection, even if it?s after eating a Half Pound Roast Beef Sandwich.? The mountainous Half Pound Roast Beef Sandwich isn?t the only place the Old Spice has been lately. This beef-tastic brouhaha began this past week when the Old Spice Guy made his presence known on the streets of New York, handing out Sweat Defense dry sprays, Arby?s gift cards and these Meat Sweat Defense kits. Decked out in an Old Spice and Arby?s SUV, the Old Spice Guy even ended up at the Meatpacking District to tell them that Arby?s has the meats. ?Whether you are scaling a Meat Mountain or a Half Pound Roast Beef, Arby?s is thrilled that our guests have access to this innovative solution that helps them fully enjoy the Meats, while avoiding the Sweats. We are big fans of Old Spice?s products and creativity, and it was a no-brainer to have a little fun with them on this program,? said Jim Taylor, Arby?s President. The Meat Sweat Defense kits are now available online at Arbysshop.com/products/meat-sweat-defense-kit for $60 (limited quantities available).

In May 2021, the brand encouraged people to #SayPubic with the launch of the Venus for Pubic Hair & Skin Collection, an array of hair removal and skincare products that care for the pubic area whether hair is there, gone, or growing. To further help de-stigmatize the term, the brand launched the viral animated video dubbed, ?The Pube Song.? Now, the brand continues their #SayPubic campaign with an encore featuring special guest and female rapper Princess Nokia. The song ?It?s Time to Care (For Your Pubic Hair) ? featuring Princess Nokia? debuts on all Venus social media channels today. Venus also recently added a Gentle Trimmer and Hair & Skin Softening Oil to its popular Venus for Pubic Hair & Skin Collection, providing even more options to care for their hair and skin in the pubic area. ?We were thrilled to see so many people taking inspiration from ?The Pube Song? last year and feeling empowered to use anatomical terms to describe their bodies,? Dana Malcolm, Senior Brand Director, says. ?However, we know that a year later there is still more work that needs to be done. It?s impossible to shift a societal norm that has been in place for centuries overnight! It?s why we?re excited to partner with Princess Nokia to launch the next chapter of this important campaign.? For Princess Nokia, partnering with Venus to help people get comfortable with saying pubic and to show up in the world as their truest self, was a natural partnership. ?I love that Venus is using all means necessary to get people comfortable with saying pubic,? says Princess Nokia, co-writer and featured artist. ?As a songwriter and rapper, I connect with my fans by helping them show up as their truest selves. For that reason, I?m excited to be working with Venus to advance this important message that gets more women comfortable talking about their bodies.? The Venus for Pubic Hair & Skin Collection offers the most complete regimen for women?s pubic regions. The full collection is pH balanced and made without parabens, dyes, fragrance, silicones, and is dermatologist and gynecologist tested. The full lineup includes: PREP: Skin Smoothing Exfoliant: For use prior to shaving or in-between hair removal days to help protect against ingrown hairs. The gentle formula exfoliates the skin?s surface to help loosen and sweep away old skin cells and oils that can trap hair.

With 1 in 3 households claiming malodor as their top laundry issue, Downy created the perfect addition to consumers? laundry routines to help solve malodor issues in the first wash, every time. ?Downy Rinse & Refresh is the latest innovation to tackle malodor in your clothes that keeps resurfacing or can?t be washed away with detergent alone,? said Sammy Wang, Downy Senior Scientist. ?This deep cleansing fabric rinse helps remove the source of odor-causing residues and hard water metal buildup that get trapped in fibers with a breakthrough, clear formula for softer, fresher, and brighter fabrics.? From smelly workout gear to garments affected by pet odors or kids' messes, there is finally a solution that allows consumers to keep their laundry fresh. Simply add Downy Rinse & Refresh to the everyday laundry regimen. Pour it directly into the fabric softener drawer, agitator cup, or add it directly into the rinse cycle (depending on the washing machine). It?s safe to use on all fabrics, including activewear, towels, delicates and baby clothes and contains no dyes or heavy perfumes. Now there?s a Downy for everyone, every fabric and for every load. ?We heard from families across the country about the need for a product that truly tackled set-in odors from their fabrics that detergents alone could not get out, so our laundry scientists developed a breakthrough solution that could easily be added to any laundry routine. Downy Rinse & Refresh is unlike anything you have seen on the market or in the fabric softener aisle, finally removing stubborn odors and residues. And since Downy Rinse & Refresh works on all fabrics, we know consumers will be delighted to use it in every load of laundry,? said Jenny Maxwell, P&G Fabric Enhancers Senior Brand Director.

With 1 in 3 households claiming malodour as their top laundry issue, Downy created the perfect addition to consumers? laundry routines to help solve malodour issues in the first wash, every time. ?Downy Rinse & Refresh is the latest innovation to tackle malodour in your clothes that keeps resurfacing or can?t be washed away with detergent alone,? said Sammy Wang, Downy Senior Scientist. ?This deep cleansing fabric rinse helps remove the source of odour-causing residues and hard water metal buildup that get trapped in fibers with a breakthrough, clear formula for softer, fresher, and brighter fabrics.? From smelly workout gear to garments affected by pet odours or kids' messes, there is finally a solution that allows consumers to keep their laundry fresh. Simply add Downy Rinse & Refresh to the everyday laundry regimen. Pour it directly into the fabric softener drawer, agitator cup, or add it directly into the rinse cycle (depending on the washing machine). It?s safe to use on all fabrics, including activewear, towels, delicates and baby clothes and contains no dyes or heavy perfumes. Now there?s a Downy for everyone, every fabric and for every load. ?We heard from families about the need for a product that truly tackled set-in odours from their fabrics that detergents alone could not get out, so our laundry scientists developed a breakthrough solution that could easily be added to any laundry routine. Downy Rinse & Refresh is unlike anything you have seen on the market or in the fabric softener aisle, finally removing stubborn odours and residues. And since Downy Rinse & Refresh works on all fabrics, we know consumers will be delighted to use it in every load of laundry,? said Jenny Maxwell, P&G Fabric Enhancers Senior Brand Director. To help launch Downy Rinse & Refresh, the brand will partner with influencers across social platforms and release a TV spot; while executing in-store activations across major retailers. Downy Rinse & Refresh will be available in Cool Cotton and Fresh Lavender at retailers nationwide for $8.99 (754 mL) and $15.99 (1.42 L), and sold at the sole discretion of the retailer.

Returns, Embraces Diversity and Inclusion On and Off Screen","CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Old Spice debuts the third chapter of the award-winning ?Men Have Skin Too? campaign with an evolution of the storyline featuring Deon Cole and Gabrielle Dennis. Alongside the couple is a new cameo from actress, producer, philanthropist, and entrepreneur La La Anthony. The ?Men Have Skin Too? series emphasizes diversity and inclusion as interdependent in the creative process. The new chapter follows another recently released spot starring actor Ross Butler. Since launching in 2019, ?Men Have Skin Too? elevates deep insights and relatable drama as Deon confidently protects his Old Spice products. The latest spots show the social awkwardness that ensues when a private disagreement becomes public, especially when the concern is his esteemed grooming products. In the spot, Deon marches through a hotel to confront Gabby and her friends, including La La Anthony, at brunch, who used the last of his GentleMan?s Blend Body Wash with Lavender and Mint. Directing the spot is Dime Davis (A Black Lady Sketch Show, Boomerang), who delivers a unique perspective to bring to life this third chapter of Deon and Gabrielle?s characters. Old Spice also introduced another spot called ?Finer Things? featuring Ross Butler (13 Reasons Why, Riverdale, To All the Boys Always And Forever, Shazam!). The spot leans into ?Men Have Skin Too? while depicting a more traditional Asian cultural point of view to resonate with Asian audiences. Research shows that two-thirds of Asians think there is not enough representation on TV. In addition, one-half feel that the portrayal of their identity is inaccurate. To embrace Asian American culture, Old Spice partnered with Plan C Agency, an Asian American marketing and communications agency. The spot depicts an involved mother obsessed with her son enjoying the ?finer? things in life and marriage. The mother attributes Ross? impossibly smooth skin to his Gentleman?s Blend with Lavender and Mint body wash, which leads her to try it for herself. Ross confronts his wife, who he thinks used the last of his Gentleman?s Blend Body Wash with Lavender and Mint, only to realize it was his mother. The ?Finer Things? spot was written and directed by Creative Director and filmmaker Clayton Tony Au. Clayton?s work in narrative films and commercials often showcases the uniqueness of the Asian American experience. Off the screen, Old Spice continues to craft science-backed formulas that delight multicultural consumers with products that look and feel superior. We continue to hear from multicultural men that they crave a body wash that not only cleanses but leaves their skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. This insight led Old Spice to formulate Gentleman?s Blend body washes with premium ingredients like petrolatum, the #1 dermatologist-recommended moisturizing ingredient. These ingredients provide all-day moisture to combat dry skin. In addition, the expert blends of light, gender-neutral scents like lavender and mint paired with a rich, creamy lather from a gentle formula create an elevated in-shower experience. The Skin Health Alliance, a global organization of independent dermatologists and skin scientists that assess the research and development behind various products, endorses Old Spice Gentleman?s Blend. With many options available in the market, the Skin Health Alliance supporting the Gentleman?s Blend lineup as safe and effective helps consumers know what?s good for their skin and confidently make the best choice for their skincare needs. ?For as long as I can remember, Old Spice body washes and deodorants have been a staple for the men in my family,? said La La Anthony. ?I am proud to partner with Old Spice for their? Men Have Skin Too? campaign and excited to be included in one of their famously funny commercials.? ?Working with companies and brands that put diversity and inclusion at the forefront of all that they do is so important to me,? Anthony continued. ?I am honored to be a part of this campaign that highlights incredible Black talent and culture.? ?Bringing together iconic cultural influences with relatable insights makes this campaign something that consumers want to talk about with friends,? said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice vice president at Procter & Gamble. ?We combine that approach with ensuring consumers have the best body care products by crafting skincare-inspired formulas that help elevate their self-care regimen.? Men Have Skin Too - The Sequel Created by Wieden Kennedy (Portland), the campaign launches with ?Brunch? featuring La La Anthony debuting on national television and the Old Spice YouTube Channel on October 6. The campaign will continue in 2023 with an additional spot also featuring La La Anthony titled ?Family Reunion? that showcases another hilarious moment of Gabrielle and others ?borrowing? Deon?s beloved Old Spice. The ?Men Have Skin Too? universe gets flipped on its head with a ?Men Have Hair Too? spot titled ?Cold? that shows Gabrielle hilariously swiping Deon?s Old Spice Moisturizing 2-in-1 Shampoo & Conditioner mid-shower. Fans can follow the integrated campaign across social media at #MenHaveSkinToo and #MenHaveHairToo.

In the first video, Anunoby is seen representing #TeamSmooth and uses the official razor of the Toronto Raptors, GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar, to shave his game face. ?My game face shows the world that, whether I?m on or off the court, I?m giving the best version of myself,? said Anunoby. ?As you can see, my game face is smooth ? a clean shave that I achieve with GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar. That?s how I feel my best and how I tell the world that I?m ready for whatever I?m about to face.? In contrast, the second video features VanVleet using the official trimmer of the Toronto Raptors, King C. Gillette, to represent #TeamStyled and groom his beard. ?I love my team, my family, my community and I want to show up for all of them daily. That?s why I make sure my game face is always on ? so I know I?m putting my best face forward for each of them,? said VanVleet. ?After styling my beard with the King C. Gillette Trimmer, I have a moment to look in the mirror and prepare for how I want to show up for myself and for those that are counting on me.? Both videos demonstrate that choosing Gillette to help put on your game face means choosing to be ready for any matchup, every day. ?Toronto Raptors players and their fans wear a range of facial hair styles and Gillette has a product to care for every one of them,? said Jennifer Seiler, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Grooming Canada at P&G. ?Every morning, men make a choice about the face they?ll present to the world. They have the choice to be the best version of themselves, for that day. A part of that choice is the debate of whether to go bearded or clean-shaven, which ultimately forces men to ask themselves which style team they will join.? Gillette has a longstanding history in the sports marketing space spanning more than 100 years and today marks the first partnership for Gillette with a Canadian professional sports team. ?We are proud to be the first Canadian professional sports team partner of Gillette and reach Raptors fans nationwide,? said Jordan Vader, Senior Vice President, Global Partnerships at MLSE. ?No matter how fans across the country choose to sport their style, this partnership gives them the tools to show up with their best game face on.?

Gillette, by visiting Gillette.ca and can look out for the partnership marked on select Gillette products at major food, drug and mass merchandise stores across Canada for the suggested retail price of $34.99 to $56.49.

Febreze Mountain transports you outside and calms your mind ? it is a complex scent that is both powerful yet calming.? Trujillo and the team of expert perfumers at the Febreze Fragrance Group, a special division within P&G?s Innovation Foresight of Fragrance and Ingredients, designed the Scent of the Year to reflect how consumers today are feeling and the scents they're craving in their home.

The campaign continues to tell the story of how Old Spice gives guys confidence under the spotlight, with freshness all day and swagger all night. Highlighted in the spots is Swaggy Spice, the brand?s first-ever Old Spice mascot, who will make his debut this week at Super Bowl LVII Opening Night. BO (body odor) is a BIG fear of many men. Procter & Gamble research shows men shower 2x more, apply deodorant 30% more frequently, and are 30% more likely to experience malodor than women. The Smelf-Confidence campaign highlights the everyday challenges guys must overcome while effortlessly avoiding the pitfalls of BO. Fortunately, the Old Spice Swagger collection provides 24/7 long-lasting freshness*. ?Old Spice wants guys everywhere to feel confident when under the spotlight,? said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice?s Vice President at Procter & Gamble. ?This new campaign is inspired by the insight that we can usually count on others to tell us if something is out of place. Maybe we have something in our teeth, or a spot on our shirt, but no one will tell us if we smell, leaving us wondering in those make-or-break moments, ?do I smell right now?? If you can?t be confident that others will tell you that you smell bad, then you need to be really confident in your grooming products.? Created by Wieden Kennedy (Portland), the Broadway-inspired ad spots feature Manuel Pacific (Terminator: Dark Fate, Ride). A Colombian-born actor, Manuel is no stranger to the spotlight, performing on international stages since the age of 7. The first spot, ?Soliloquy,? will begin airing on national television along with YouTube, Vevo, TikTok, and Reddit. The second spot, ?Tango,? will premiere later this spring. Make Room for Swaggy Spice, Old Spice?s First-Ever Mascot Speaking of keeping it cool and fresh under the spotlight, Old Spice is introducing the freshest, campaign-inspired mascot, Swaggy Spice. Mascots have to do it all - dance, dunk and make us laugh - all while under the spotlight of thousands of fans. However, what people don?t realize is mascots can sweat up to 10 pounds per game, making them the stinkiest thing in the stadium. What better way to pressure test Old Spice Swagger?s 24/7 long-lasting freshness than in one of the sweatiest conditions ? a mascot costume in Phoenix? Decked out in stylish accessories, Swaggy Spice will deliver the same odor/sweat protection to the masses at one of the most stressful, high-intensity events of the year, the Super Bowl. ?It?s a real honor to become THE most famous deodorant stick of all time and spread the word about my 24/7 long-lasting freshness,? said Swaggy Spice, the official mascot of Old Spice. ?I always had big dreams thanks to my confidence-inducing fragrance and odor protection but never expected to reach the pinnacle of deodorant stardom with Old Spice. Shout out to my good-smelling friends and family who believed in me as a young deodorant stick with one dream?to deliver Smelf-Confidence to guys everywhere.? During his surprise appearances this week, Swaggy Spice will hand out samples, engage fans around Phoenix, and walk the Super Bowl LVII red carpets with celebrity handlers. Old Spice Swagger Lineup Old Spice Swagger lineup is back with newly-designed packaging and the famed Old Spice odor and sweat fighting technology that gives 24/7 freshness to those who use it every day.

Crest Has You Covered With New Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste, The Only One Of Its Kind On The Market Today","CINCINNATI, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--More than 60 years after disrupting the oral care category with the first-ever fluoride toothpaste, Crest is once again reinventing the way we think about brushing with an innovation the whole family will smile about. From the #1 Toothpaste Brand in America comes new Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste, harnessing the magic of color to encourage kids to brush up to two times longer to protect against cavities. As the category leader, Crest set out to address the ongoing struggle parents face in getting kids to brush their teeth. The experience is almost universal, with a majority of kids brushing less than the dentist recommended amount ? two minutes, twice per day. Crest Kids? newest innovation unlocks the power of color-changing technology to transform bubblegum-flavored toothpaste from blue to pink after two minutes of brushing, creating an enjoyable experience for kids and parents alike. ?We know that consistent brushing at a young age is critical to conquering cavities, and until now no other product on the market has been able to create a true change in children?s brushing habits,? said Luis Restrepo, Senior Director North America Oral Care at Procter & Gamble. ?As the only one of its kind on the market today, new Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste redefines the expectations of what a children?s toothpaste can do by making brushing fun to establish healthy, lifelong oral care habits.? To celebrate the launch of new Color Changing Toothpaste, Crest Kids teamed up with social media creator Dani Schaffer and her colorful son Brody to serve as the brand?s official Kid Correspondent and report how Crest Kids? newest toothpaste has brightened up daily brushing routines. ?As a busy mom with a full house, it has always been a challenge to wrangle my kids and get them to brush their teeth consistently,? said Dani Schaffer. ?Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste has changed the game! Brody, my youngest, is actually asking me when he can brush his teeth ? he loves watching as the color transforms, and it gives me peace of mind knowing his smile is protected against cavities while still having so much fun.? Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste, along with a full lineup of Oral-B color-changing themed toothbrushes, is now available online and in-store at retailers nationwide. Crest Kids Color Changing Toothpaste: $3.99 Oral-B Kids Color Changing Manual Toothbrush: $3.99 Oral-B Kids Color Changing Battery Power Toothbrush: $14.99 Oral-B Kids Color Changing Electric Toothbrush: $23.99 About Crest A trusted leader in oral health, Crest was the first oral care brand to secure the ADA Seal of Acceptance for a clinically proven fluoride toothpaste. Since first introducing fluoride toothpaste 65 years ago, it is estimated that Crest has helped prevent countless cavities in the United States.

Time to ?Get Sheet Done? With Bounty?sﾃδεつづδづつｮ Newest Paper Towel Innovation,"CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bounty paper towels are launching an even better version of the Quicker Picker Upper just in time for Spring cleaning. Spring cleaning procrastinators your new best friend, Bounty, is here to help and apparently a lot of you need it. Most Americans (87%) have procrastinated their household cleaning2, according to a recent survey by Reputation Leaders for Bounty. This Spring, new Bounty paper towels are hitting store shelves with a goal of helping people tackle the cleaning tasks they?ve been putting off. No stranger to going out of her way to avoid cleaning, Bounty has partnered with self-proclaimed cleaning procrastinator Adrienne Bailon-Houghton to encourage everyone get sheet done this Spring. ?Yes, I?m busy and a new mom, but in all honesty, I genuinely stress about cleaning and avoid it,? says NAACP and Emmy Award winning host & producer, Adrienne Bailon-Houghton. ?I completely relate to the third of all Americans who would rather balance their budget than clean3. I mean, taxes or a toilet bowl? Taxes please! I even watch people use Bounty on #CleanTok over actually cleaning. But I?m all out of excuses thanks to new Bounty. Since one sheet can now go so much further, I can tackle the cleaning tasks I?ve been putting off!? Bounty?s newest innovative paper towel is a triple threat, driven by superior structure, flexible strength, and optimized fluid efficiencies, allowing you to use less to clean up the toughest messes. Bounty?s new proprietary microstructure is larger than our previous design and built to hold up under pressure. You may not see it, but you can feel the difference. The microstructure has an optimized column design. Some competitors collapse when wet whereas Bounty?s newest paper towel technology expands to hold in the mess. Bounty?s microstructure has dedicated strong and flexible zones making it cloth-like. Bounty is obsessed with continual innovation; the new microstructure creates dedicated absorbance zones which pump and direct liquid more evenly through the sheet, trapping and locking the mess in both sheet directions. ?We know some Americans would rather pull weeds than clean4 ? me included,? said Gregg Weaver, Bounty Senior Scientist. ?Our newest paper towel sheets are more absorbent, so you can use less to clean up the toughest messes. So, for the third of Americans that rather would do anything other than clean5, know that Bounty?s newest paper towel is even better than previous versions and keeps working until the job is done, so you can do more and use less.? Still need a little motivation? Cleaning procrastinators confirmed that after cleaning even a little bit, 8 in 10 feel so much better6, and 1 in 3 wanted to keep going7. Stop avoiding cleaning and show us how you #GetSheetDone with Bounty at @bountypapertowels.

The dermatologically approved Venus for Facial Hair & Skin Care Collection offers a cleansing primer, a dermaplaning razor, and a hydrating serum that are designed to work in perfect harmony for instantly glowing skin. ?Our commitment to every woman?s right to feel comfortable and live freely in her own skin is at the forefront in all our product innovation and why we strive to provide multiple product solutions for women, whatever their grooming routine is,? says Dana Malcolm, Senior Brand Director, North America P&G Female Shave Care. ?Dermaplaning is something many women are doing or are interested in but can sometimes feel overwhelming to adopt into their beauty routines. We are now excited to introduce a complete dermaplaning regimen with Venus for Facial Hair & Skin Care with OLAY to allow every person to glow their own way.? The new collection includes a cleansing primer, dermaplaning razor and hydrating serum. An electric mini hair remover is also available for touch-ups. ?In our research, we found that women were searching for clarity on the best way to care for their skin while dermaplaning. There was a need for a full regimen, with specially formulated products to use throughout the process,? said Elizabeth Compo, Senior Scientist for P&G Female Shave Care. ?In addition to efficacy, we also heard that safety was top of mind, which is why we ensured all products in the collection are dermatologically tested for sensitive skin and endorsed by the Skin Health Alliance.? The full skincare regimen includes: CLEANSE & PREP: Dermaplaning Facial Cleansing Primer ? This no rinse, non-astringent formula, with cucumber and aloe, is for use prior to dermaplaning or as a cleanser and toner for in-between hair removal days to cleanse and hydrate facial hair and skin. The balanced combination of skin conditioners and gentle cleansing ingredients work together to optimally prepare skin for dermaplaning, sweeping away debris, leaving facial hair and skin clean and refreshed without drying the skin out. SMOOTH & EXFOLIATE: Dermaplaning Razor ? This dermaplaning razor instantly and visibly removes fine facial hair and layers of dead skin. The razor?s design features a high-quality blade surrounded by Skin Defense Guard, rounded protective tip for safety to provide a controlled and comfortable shave. Additionally, switching to a new blade is made easy with a ?click? dock for quick blade changes. This refillable facial razor makes for a more sustainable choice compared to the common disposable options. Our dermaplaning razor?s blade edge is also up to 20% thinner compared to other dermaplaning tool blades on the market which reduces the force it takes to cut through hair. HYDRATE: Dermaplaning Hydration Serum ? This water-based serum replenishes hydration to soothe and refresh skin after dermaplaning, leaving skin smooth, bright, and refreshed. Formulated with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, witch hazel, cucumber, aloe, and vitamins B3 and B5, the serum is specifically made for dermaplaning and is non-comedogenic, oil-free and fragrance and dye-free. MAINTAIN & TOUCH UP: Mini Hair Remover ? This mini hair remover is designed to gently remove hair anywhere, anytime, even on the go. It is specially designed for the contours of the face, with its unique rotary system blades that are gentle on lips, chin, and cheeks for effortless hair removal. The device is also easy to maneuver with its built-in smart light to spot any unwanted hairs. More information on Venus for Facial Hair & Skin Care with OLAY can be found on https://www.gillettevenus.com/en-us/facial-hair-skin-care/.

(WIT), were recognized on March 28 for their tremendous advocacy work ? helping to create and pass Alabama?s ?period poverty? law in April 2022, which allocates $200,000 to the Alabama Department of Education to provide grants for menstrual products to students in Title I schools. Engage ? a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting women?s economic security through bipartisan and commonsense solutions ? honored Brooke and Breanna with the first-ever Engage Woman Award for Non-Profit Leadership ? making them the youngest award recipients of the night at Engage?s Remarkable Women Reception and Dinner in Washington, D.C. The award was presented to the Bennett sisters by U.S. Senator Katie Britt (R-Ala.), who remarked on their demonstration of leadership in their collective home state of Alabama and ongoing commitment to help vulnerable young women unlock the American Dream. ?I was thrilled for Montgomery?s Brooke and Breanna Bennett as they accepted the Engage Woman Award for Non-Profit Leadership recently in Washington, D.C.,? said Senator Britt in a social media post about the event. ?The future is bright as long as we have leaders like Breanna and Brooke working to grow opportunity for others so they can reach their full potential.? 1 in 5 girls in the U.S. have missed school due to lack of access to period products1. The Bennett sisters are helping to alleviate this issue ? starting in their home state of Alabama ? and encouraging others across the U.S. to enact nation-wide policy change to help #EndPeriodPoverty. To date, only 22 states have passed a law to provide free period products to some capacity. ?It is an incredible honor to be awarded the Engage Woman Award for Non-Profit Leadership and be recognized among all the incredible Engage Woman Award recipients ? not to mention speaking about an issue near and dear to our heart in front of change makers in Washington, D.C.,? said Brooke Bennett, Co-Founder of Women in Training, Inc. ?Through Women in Training, Inc., we realize we're doing something greater than providing period products to people in need ? we are inspiring change in not just our home state, but across the country. Systemic change to help #EndPeriodPoverty is needed and is possible across the U.S. by supporting legislation like Congresswoman Grace Meng?s Menstrual Equity for All Act. Together, we can all help #EndPeriodPoverty,? said Breanna Bennett, Co-Founder of Women in Training, Inc. Brooke and Breanna have a long-standing partnership with Always, the leader in global menstrual care. This past year, Always organized the first-ever team of ?50 Period Heroes? ? WIT being one of them ? to help fight period poverty across the country while donating 3.5 million pads to communities in all 50 states. Always Period Heroes represent people and organizations in each of the 50 U.S. states who have already made significant efforts to address period poverty in their local area. Together, they are helping to ensure people across the country have access to the products they need to stay confident while working towards systemic change for the next generation so period protection doesn?t stand in the way of education and confidence ever again.

(WIT); and, Feeding Americaﾃδεつづδづつｮ, the nation?s largest domestic hunger-relief organization, rallied together in Washington D.C. in support of Congresswoman Grace Meng?s Menstrual Equity for All Act. The Act would ensure people have access to free period products in federal buildings and schools so that no one would have to miss out because of their period. Period poverty is defined as a lack of access to period protection ? and it affects millions of people around the world, even in the most economically developed countries. Here in the U.S., 1 in 5 girls have missed school due to the lack of access to period products1 ? that is more than 3.5 million girls2. Since the launch of Always? #EndPeriodPoverty program in 2018, Always has donated more than 235 million period products to those in need around the world, including more than 75 million in the U.S. in partnership with Feeding America and other organizations. However, donations alone cannot resolve the systemic issue of period poverty. The stigma surrounding periods can prevent those affected from voicing their needs and prevents potential solutions from being widely discussed and implemented. To date, only 22 states have passed a law to provide free period products in some capacity. There is a need for national change to solve the issue of period poverty and if passed, Congresswoman Grace Meng?s Menstrual Equity for All Act would help do just that across the U.S. ?People are often unaware the impact period poverty is having on so many individuals in their own communities and across the nation. Millions of people in the United States and around the world lack access to period products and are forced to forego educational or employment opportunities because of it,? said Congresswoman Grace Meng. ?We cannot thrive as a society or economy without the full participation and education of women, girls, and people with periods in society. That is why I am proud to reintroduce my Menstrual Equity for All Act, a whole-of-government approach that will help ensure affordable access to menstrual products so that we can end period poverty.? To help address the ongoing need for period products, Always and International Paper ? alongside congressional staff and Feeding America ? hosted an event in Washington D.C. on May 24 to drive awareness around the issue of period poverty and the need for legislative policy, while packing 600 kits with period products to be given to Greater DC Diaper Bank and Mary?s Center. As part of the event, Always recognized and honored the incredible work of Always Period Heroes. Period Heroes represent people and organizations across the U.S. who have already made significant efforts to address period poverty in their local area. Always recognized International Paper, Brooke and Breanna Bennett, Feeding America and Congresswoman Grace Meng for their valuable contributions in our collective mission to help #EndPeriodPoverty. More About Our Period Heroes: International Paper: International Paper transforms renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day ? including pulp for personal care products. Throughout 2023, International Paper and Always will hold 50 period packing events at facilities across the country to ensure that people have the essential items they need to stay in school. Brooke and Breanna Bennett ? Co-Founders of Women in Training, Inc: At just 15-years-old, twin sisters Brooke and Breanna ignited change in Alabama by helping to pass Alabama?s ?period poverty? law in April 2022, which allocates $200,000 to the Alabama Department of Education to provide grants for menstrual products to students in Title I schools. Feeding America: Feeding America has been a long-standing partner of Always, working alongside them since the launch of the #EndPeriodPoverty program in 2018. The Feeding America network of food banks serves families who face hunger and may not be able to afford basic non-food household goods including period products.3 Feeding America, among other organizations, have helped to provide 75 million period products in the U.S. Congresswoman Grace Meng: Congresswoman Grace Meng is working to drive real systemic change and help #EndPeriodPoverty for good with the re-introduction of the Menstrual Equity for All Act ? the first whole-of-government approach to address this issue. ?Always? brand purpose is built on the ability to foster girls? confidence, especially during puberty. When someone isn?t properly protected during their period, it puts their confidence, dignity, and education at risk,? said Balaka Niyazee, Senior Vice President of North America Feminine Care at Procter & Gamble. ?Our purpose fuels our ongoing commitment to raise awareness of the issue of period poverty, donate products, tackle stigma, and help drive systemic change. As a mother of a 12-year-old daughter, I am motivated to do more so she can enter puberty feeling supported and educated. Always is proud to continue to partner with International Paper and Feeding America ? together we are advocating for the Menstrual Equity for All Act so all girls can stay confident and stay in school.? The Impact of Period Poverty in the U.S.: While several U.S. states have increased action to help #EndPeriodPoverty, 56% of society believes they should do more to provide free products to those needing them4. Of girls that have missed school because of period poverty, not only did 49% of them say that missing school negatively impacted their academic performance, but 3 out of 5 tried to hide it from the people around them5. Students who were more regularly absent in early years of school were less likely to vote, reported having greater economic difficulties and had poorer educational outcomes when they were 22 to 23 years old6. ?We're proud to partner with Always and Feeding America to help address the issue of period poverty,? said Sophie Beckham, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, International Paper. ?Our award-winning Fighting Period Poverty in Our Communities program which provides period care kits containing supplies for women and girls who have no access to these products, helps us make progress on our Vision 2030 goal of improving the lives of 100 million people in our communities by creating positive impact.?

Some of these brands are known for their risque marketing. There?s a balance between print and television ads with questionable slogans. Also: Are You On Track to Retire? Take This Quiz and Find Out (Sponsored) While we would all love to live in a world of the ?Mad Men? television show where every marketer is incredibly wise, this isn?t always the case. Of course, every good advertising campaign starts with good intentions, but sometimes, even well-intentioned slogans can be wildly questionable. This is exactly the case with all of the slogans mentioned here. Unfortunately, sometimes marketing slogans made in a room with just a few people are better off having never made it into the hands of consumers. 16. ?Touching Is Good? Nintendo?s slogan for its DS console was poorly received. Rolled out as part of a marketing campaign promoting its new Nintendo DS video game console, Nintendo didn?t think through this slogan. As part of a $40 million campaign highlighting the device?s launch, Nintendo?s hope to come off as edgy was just creepy. 15. ?The Perfect Beer for Removing ?No? From Your Vocabulary for The Night? Bud Light apologized for its ad campaign, which people quickly complained about. Bud Light launched the ad as part of its ?UpForWhatever? campaign to help people experience new things. Of course, it wasn?t interpreted in the way the company intended, and instead, Bud Light was assaulted with complaints that the ad promoted sexual assault. 14. ?If It Doesn?t Get All Over the Place, It Doesn?t Belong In Your Face? Carl?s Jr wanted to use sex to sell its hamburgers. Introduced in the mid-1990s by fast food restaurant Carl?s Jr., the slogan was used by the company to sell itself through sex. The ads supporting the slogan showed young and attractive singles eating hamburgers with food spilling all over them. Surprisingly, Carl?s Jr. doubled down on the ad when people complained and told them to watch PBS. 13. ?This Mother?s Day, Get Back To The Job That Really Matters? Proctor and Gamble is not the company you?d expect to launch a terrible slogan. A 2011 print ad by Proctor and Gamble was undeniably sexist. Even though the world knew the ad was sexist, there were mixed opinions on what it meant to imply. Ultimately, most people landed on this ad promoting teaching your daughter her place in society is to clean up after a man. 12. ?Spike Your Best Friend?s Eggnog When They?re Not Looking? Bloomingdale?s mailed a catalog with a terrible slogan. Created by high-end clothing retailer Bloomingdales, this slogan was included in the company?s 2015 Christmas catalog. Accusations were swift that the ad encouraged date rape forcing Bloomingdale?s to apologize. 11. ?Look Like a Girl, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, Work Like a Boss? Bic pens are wildly popular but this slogan, not so much. Created by pen manufacturer Bic, this South African slogan celebrating Women?s Day was understandably poorly received. The company posted the ad on its Facebook page and quickly deleted it after the ad received an influx of complaints about the language. 10. ?She Can Have a Tummy?And Still Look Yummy!? What horrible language, even for the 1950s. This is a print marketing ad for the Chubette clothing line in 1957. There is just so much wrong with it. It?s impossible to imagine how this slogan got approved, thankfully, before the age of social media. The goal was to promote slim-fitting clothes for girls ages 6-16, but wow, just wow. 9. ?The More You Play With It, The Harder It Gets? Sega was well known for its daring ad campaigns. Aimed at the UK market, Sega released several print ads advertising its Mega Drive (Genesis) video game console. This language, even from a company known for bold marketing, no doubt pushed well past the line, but it was never pulled, and Sega never responded to any controversy. 8. ?Perfect Body? Victoria?s Secret has learned its lesson with this slogan. In 2014, Victoria?s Secret saw its new ?Perfect Body? campaign erupt into a social media firestorm. The slogan accompanied an ad with ten very thin models, and the pushback of the ad came fast and furious. The company quickly changed the online ad to read ?A Body for Every Body.? 7. ?More Doctors Smoke Camels Than Any Other Cigarette? Camel claimed that doctors were approving its cigarettes. During a time when the dangers of smoking weren?t truly well known, Camel promoted itself in print ads with this now incredibly misleading saying. Of course, the doctors in the ads were not real, and it?s impossible to imagine a world where any doctor would ever promote such a habit. 6. ?Dieting Doesn?t Work, Weight Watchers Does.? I don?t know how Weight Watchers approved this slogan. There is no question that Weight Watchers has successfully helped people lose weight, but this time, it had to lose a campaign slogan quickly. The hope was to promote Weight Watchers as the ideal diet choice, but the ad was perceived as ridiculous since the brand and dieting are so closely aligned. 5. ?You Can Never Be Too Thin? Pretzel Crisp?s effort to be crafty fell very flat. What sounds like an ad from the 1960s was actually from a 2010 Good Housekeeping magazine. Pretzel Crisps, a popular pretzel snack, attempted to fat-shame the population with the slogan ?You can never be too thin.? To no one?s surprise, the ad was quickly pulled. 4. ?It?s Not For Women? Dr. Pepper sure wished it could take back this slogan. Somehow, the team at Dr. Pepper approved this slogan in 2011, which, unsurprisingly, was only short-lived. The drink, Dr. Pepper Ten, was intended to focus on a male audience, but what was intended as irony came off as sexist and was pulled after receiving national attention. 3. ?White Is Purity? Nivea quickly took down this slogan. It?s almost impossible to think of how the marketing department at Nivea?s Middle East business approved this slogan. Created in support of a new spray deodorant, it was said to reference the whole ?invisible? deodorant idea that won?t stain your clothes. Of course, it came off as racist, and other Nivea branches, like inside the US, had to distance themselves from the event. 2. ?Cheat On Your Girlfriend, Not Your Workout? Reebok quickly backtracked on this German ad. Debuted in Germany by Reebook, this campaign slogan was unsurprisingly short-lived. Reebok was accused of being both sexist and misogynistic and even lacking an understanding of its female audience. The company was forced to remark that it did not condone ?cheating in any way.? 1. ?Coolest Monkey In The Jungle? Shockingly, H&amp;M approved this slogan. What seems like a good ad for a zoo was actually an advertising campaign from popular clothing retailer H&amp;M. Released in 2018, the slogan itself doesn?t appear to have much wrong until you realize it?s alongside a young child model of African-American male descent. As ?monkey? is considered a racial epithet, H&amp;M apologized for the ad and pulled any clothing that included the language.
