This award brings the total vehicle orders for the ACV to 116, and moves the program closer to full-rate production. The ACV is a highly mobile, survivable and adaptable platform for conducting rapid ship-to-shore operations and brings enhanced combat power to the battlefield. BAE Systems has been in low-rate production since 2018 on the personnel carrier variant in the ACV family, which is envisioned to consist of additional variants including command and control, 30mm medium caliber turret, and recovery versions. ÃÂÃÂThe ACV provides the most survivable and mobile amphibious vehicle to the U.S. Marines Corps for supporting the warfightersÃÂÃÂ ability to successfully execute their unique expeditionary missions,ÃÂÃÂ said John Swift, director of amphibious programs at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂThis award further demonstrates our commitment to that mission, itÃÂÃÂs an important milestone for the program and represents a major step toward full rate production.ÃÂÃÂ The BAE Systems team and the U.S. Marine Corps have been making significant strides to reach full-rate production, including the successful completion of Logistics Demonstration as a critical enabler for the program to move into Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) with trained U.S. Marine maintainers. This and other major milestones such as operator training and additional testing will take place before full-rate production. The Marine Corps selected BAE Systems along with teammate Iveco Defence Vehicles for the ACV program to replace its legacy fleet of Assault Amphibious Vehicles, which have been in service for decades and were also built by BAE Systems. ACV production and support is taking place at BAE Systems locations in Stafford, Virginia; San Jose, California; Sterling Heights, Michigan; Aiken, South Carolina; and York, Pennsylvania.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200226005484/en/U.S.-Marine-Corps-Orders-More-Amphibious-Combat-Vehicles-from-BAE-Systems,businesswire.com,5,stafford vabusiness wirebae system received million contract u marine corp additional amphibious combat vehicle acv lowrate initial production lrip phase program award brings total vehicle order acv move program closer fullrate production acv highly mobile survivable adaptable platform conducting rapid shiptoshore operation brings enhanced combat power battlefield bae system lowrate production since personnel carrier variant acv family envisioned consist additional variant including command control mm medium caliber turret recovery version acv provides survivable mobile amphibious vehicle u marine corp supporting warfighters ability successfully execute unique expeditionary mission said john swift director amphibious program bae system award demonstrates commitment mission important milestone program represents major step toward full rate production bae system team u marine corp making significant stride reach fullrate production including successful completion logistics demonstration critical enabler program move initial operational test evaluation iote trained u marine maintainer major milestone operator training additional testing take place fullrate production marine corp selected bae system along teammate iveco defence vehicle acv program replace legacy fleet assault amphibious vehicle service decade also built bae system acv production support taking place bae system location stafford virginia san jose california sterling height michigan aiken south carolina york pennsylvania,0.946,0.473,0.1112975,0.3617025,Positive Impact

The initial contract was awarded in February with $24 million funded, followed by contract modifications of $99 million and $43 million received in March and May respectively. Options on the contract include additional canister types for future Navy production requirements. ÃÂÃÂThese canisters are a key element of the NavyÃÂÃÂs Vertical Launching System, and our experience includes 30 years of VLS production, integration and testing to support this world-class capability,ÃÂÃÂ said Brent Butcher, vice president and general manager of the Weapon Systems product line at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂThe Navy will continue to benefit from our high-quality canisters and lean, efficient operations, which translate into the best possible value for our customers.ÃÂÃÂ VLS canisters serve in a multifaceted role as containers for missile shipping and storage as well as launch tubes when loaded into the VLS. They also provide identification and firing support to multiple missile types, including the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, Standard Missile-2, Standard Missile-3, Standard Missile-6, and the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile. Under this latest contract, BAE Systems will produce canisters not only for the U.S. fleet but also for allied nations under a Foreign Military Sales program. Deliveries for the initial order are expected to begin in early 2021, and if all options are exercised, the contract could support the production of canisters over a five-year period, with deliveries extending into 2025.

ÃÂÃÂWe are committed to collaborating with New York as it strives to reduce transportation emissions and improve air quality in the communities across the state,ÃÂÃÂ said Steve Trichka, vice president and general manager of Power & Propulsion Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂOur Series-E system provides transit operators with a highly reliable, flexible option that brings our state one step closer to a zero emission future.ÃÂÃÂ The Series-E systems will be produced at the companyÃÂÃÂs state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Endicott, New York, which provide more than 1,300 high-tech jobs in the state. ÃÂÃÂItÃÂÃÂs a great day for New YorkÃÂÃÂs Southern Tier as BAE Systems of Endicott has been selected to provide electric hybrid bus technology to New York City Transit Authority,ÃÂÃÂ said Donna Lupardo, Assemblywoman for New York State. ÃÂÃÂThis BAE Systems contract is just one of many from cities around the world that can say its transportation system has been built and supported by a New York company, based right here in our community. IÃÂÃÂm very proud to have supported their winning bid and wish them continued success in the future.ÃÂÃÂ The Series-E system combines motors, energy storage, and smart controls to create a clean form of electric drive power for buses and their accessories such as air conditioning, air compressors, cooling systems, heat, power steering, and doors. The system features the companyÃÂÃÂs power-dense ultracapacitor technology, which provides efficient and reliable energy storage for the life of the bus. With fully electrified accessories, each bus can also support engine stop/start technology for idle reduction. This feature allows the bus engine to turn off at stops, while the accessories on board continue to operate on electric power. BAE Systems has 20-plus years of experience in the development and integration of electric propulsion and accessory systems for transit buses. The company first pioneered its technology for the transit industry in 1998, when it fielded New York City's first electric hybrid bus fitted with lead-acid batteries. With the new order, BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ footprint will extend to more than 2,000 transit buses across the state of New York and more than 12,000 worldwide, including cities such as Paris and London. Each year those systems help to save more than 25 million gallons of fuel and more than 300,000 tons of COÃÂÃÂ² from entering the earth's atmosphere.

LR-PGK is a critical program in the ArmyÃÂÃÂs 155mm Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) munitions suite, designed to deliver accurate, lethal fires at greater ranges than near-peer adversaries. The BAE Systems solution builds on proven, mature technology, offering greater performance than current guidance kits through increased maneuverability and an incorporated anti-jam capability. ÃÂÃÂWeÃÂÃÂre helping the Army meet its precision strike objectives with this critical long range artillery capability,ÃÂÃÂ said John Watkins, vice president of Precision Strike at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂOur experience in precision guidance, rugged electronics, and artillery platforms has helped us develop a kit that improves mission effectiveness.ÃÂÃÂ Under the new contract, BAE Systems will produce a series of LR-PGK fuzes for live-fire testing, further validating the solution and demonstrating its accuracy and reliability in challenging battlefield conditions. Prior to the award, BAE Systems successfully demonstrated the LR-PGK capability and performance at Yuma Proving Ground in September 2019. The company committed significant investment to deliver on the ArmyÃÂÃÂs modernization goals by intentionally designing the LR-PGKÃÂÃÂs modular architecture for low-cost production and upgradeability. LR-PGK is one of several BAE Systems programs that support Long Range Precision Fires, one of the U.S. ArmyÃÂÃÂs top modernization priorities. In addition to designing and manufacturing the M109 family of Self-Propelled Howitzers, BAE Systems has developed and delivered guidance systems for precision munitions for decades and is a major supplier of artillery round explosives and propellants.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200722005518/en/BAE-Systems-Receives-33-Million-Contract-to-Produce-Long-Range-Artillery-Guidance-System,businesswire.com,5,hudson nhbusiness wirebae system received million multiyear contract u army develop long range precision guidance kit lrpgk mm artillery shell enabling army conduct long range precision strike challenging electromagnetic environment lrpgk critical program army mm extended range cannon artillery erca munition suite designed deliver accurate lethal fire greater range nearpeer adversary bae system solution build proven mature technology offering greater performance current guidance kit increased maneuverability incorporated antijam capability helping army meet precision strike objective critical long range artillery capability said john watkins vice president precision strike bae system experience precision guidance rugged electronics artillery platform helped u develop kit improves mission effectiveness new contract bae system produce series lrpgk fuze livefire testing validating solution demonstrating accuracy reliability challenging battlefield condition prior award bae system successfully demonstrated lrpgk capability performance yuma proving ground september company committed significant investment deliver army modernization goal intentionally designing lrpgks modular architecture lowcost production upgradeability lrpgk one several bae system program support long range precision fire one u army top modernization priority addition designing manufacturing family selfpropelled howitzer bae system developed delivered guidance system precision munition decade major supplier artillery round explosive propellant,0.9633,0.48165,0.2208966667,0.2607533333,Positive Impact

ÃÂÃÂARCHER is a mature, proven system that can quickly get into the fight and strike enemy targets at long ranges, with a high rate of fire and very fast displacement times, and is made for combat against large power adversaries,ÃÂÃÂ said Chris King, director of business development at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂWith a fully automated system, soldiers can execute their mission with minimal physical exertion and time, while remaining under cover in the armored cabin. The cab protection, fast shoot and scoot times and its extended range all enhance survivability and sustain fire support in harsh combat conditions.ÃÂÃÂ ARCHER brings a single, fielded package of capabilities that would provide U.S. soldiers with responsiveness and flexibility that far exceed current capabilities. ARCHER is typically operated by a crew of three to four soldiers but can be operated by only one. ARCHER can fire within 30 seconds of receiving an order. It can then depart its firing position within 30 seconds, minimizing the enemyÃÂÃÂs ability to effectively return fire. Its magazine carries 21 rounds and can unload all of them in less than three minutes. ARCHER can fire the BONUS anti-armor munition up to 35 km, conventional munitions up to 40 km, and currently fielded precision-guided munitions like Excalibur in excess of 50 km. BONUS and Excalibur are currently in the U.S. ArmyÃÂÃÂs inventory.

BAE Systems was the only company awarded contracts for three of the programÃÂÃÂs four focus areas, designed to advance manned and unmanned teaming (MUM-T) capabilities that are expected to be critical components in the U.S. ArmyÃÂÃÂs Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. In order to combat the increasingly complex, contested, and communication-denied battlespace presented by near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Army developed the A-Team program to create an automated system to offload the cognitive burden of pilots while enabling them to command swarms of unmanned aircraft. ÃÂÃÂOur mature autonomy technology, which is the basis of our offering for the A-Team program, will greatly increase the warfighterÃÂÃÂs ability to have a complete view of the battlespace and streamline decision making,ÃÂÃÂ said Chris Eisenbies, product line director of the Autonomy, Control, and Estimation group at BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST LabsÃÂÃÂ. ÃÂÃÂFuture conflicts will include manned and unmanned teaming and increased automation in highly contested environments, helping to enable mission success.ÃÂÃÂ BAE Systems was selected to deliver a highly automated system to provide situational awareness, information processing, resource management, and decision making that is beyond human capabilities. These advantages become exceedingly important as the Army moves toward mission teams of unmanned aircraft that will be controlled by pilots in real time. The contracts total $9 million and include awards for the Human Machine Interface, Platform Resource Capability Management, and Situational Awareness Management elements of the program. To deliver the critical autonomy technology, BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST Labs research and development team and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems business area will leverage their decades of work pioneering autonomy technologies. The program will leverage the Future Open Rotorcraft Cockpit Environment Lab to conduct simulation tests and demonstrations with products from different contractors in consideration of transition to the FVL program.

This is the second time in four years that the company has performed significant work onboard the Wasp to sustain its warfighting capability. Under the new contract, BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ Norfolk shipyard will begin working aboard the 843-foot-long USS Wasp in February 2021, performing hull, tank and mechanical work. The contract includes options that, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value to $237.7 million. During the companyÃÂÃÂs last maintenance availability aboard the Wasp, from December 2016 to May 2017, BAE Systems added modifications to support Joint Strike Fighter operations onboard. ÃÂÃÂBAE Systems is very familiar with USS Wasp, performing substantial upgrade work onboard before its forward deployment to Japan three years ago,ÃÂÃÂ said Mark Whitney, deputy general manager of BAE Systems Ship Repair and general manager of Norfolk Ship Repair. ÃÂÃÂOur team of skilled tradespeople and subcontractors look forward to executing another long sustainment period on Wasp, to ensure the ship retains its sharp warfighting capability.ÃÂÃÂ The USS Wasp is the lead ship of a class of U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships. It is the 10th Navy vessel to bear the name since 1775. To prepare for drydocking the Wasp, BAE Systems sent its largest floating drydock in Norfolk to a Baltimore, Maryland, shipyard for five months of lifecycle maintenance. The drydock, called ÃÂÃÂTitan,ÃÂÃÂ returned to Norfolk earlier this month. The lifecycle maintenance work performed on Titan drydock will enable the yard to service the largest Navy ships in the port of Norfolk for another 20 to 25 years. Titan is capable of lifting up to 52,500 long tons. The USS Wasp displaces about 40,500 long tons. BAE Systems is a leading provider of ship repair, maintenance, modernization, conversion, and overhaul services for the Navy, other government agencies, and select commercial customers. The company operates four full-service shipyards in California, Florida, Hawaii, and Virginia, and offers a highly skilled, experienced workforce, seven dry docks and railways, and significant pier space and ship support services.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124006047/en/U.S.-Navy-awards-197-million-contract-to-BAE-Systems-for-USS-Wasp-modernization,businesswire.com,5,norfolk vabusiness wirebae system received million contract u navy drydock perform maintenance modernization work aboard amphibious assault ship us wasp lhd second time four year company performed significant work onboard wasp sustain warfighting capability new contract bae system norfolk shipyard begin working aboard footlong us wasp february performing hull tank mechanical work contract includes option exercised would bring cumulative value million company last maintenance availability aboard wasp december may bae system added modification support joint strike fighter operation onboard bae system familiar us wasp performing substantial upgrade work onboard forward deployment japan three year ago said mark whitney deputy general manager bae system ship repair general manager norfolk ship repair team skilled tradespeople subcontractor look forward executing another long sustainment period wasp ensure ship retains sharp warfighting capability us wasp lead ship class u navy amphibious assault ship th navy vessel bear name since prepare drydocking wasp bae system sent largest floating drydock norfolk baltimore maryland shipyard five month lifecycle maintenance drydock called titan returned norfolk earlier month lifecycle maintenance work performed titan drydock enable yard service largest navy ship port norfolk another year titan capable lifting long ton us wasp displaces long ton bae system leading provider ship repair maintenance modernization conversion overhaul service navy government agency select commercial customer company operates four fullservice shipyard california florida hawaii virginia offer highly skilled experienced workforce seven dry dock railway significant pier space ship support service,0.802,0.401,0.40774,-0.00674,Negative Impact

Die Series-ER-Systeme (Electric Range) werden Irlands Flotte von bis zu 600 Hybridbussen vom Typ Enviro400ER antreiben. BAE Systems hat bereits Systeme fÃÂÃÂ¼r die ersten 100 Busse ausgeliefert und wird im nÃÂÃÂ¤chsten Jahr weitere 180 Systeme fÃÂÃÂ¼r Busse liefern. Das Series-ER-System baut auf mehr als 20 Jahren Innovation und bewÃÂÃÂ¤hrter Technologie des Unternehmens auf und treibt weltweit schon mehr als 13.000 Busse an. Diese Technologie ist in Bussen in ganz Europa im Einsatz, darunter in StÃÂÃÂ¤dten wie Brighton, London, Namur und Paris. Die irischen Busse sind weltweit die ersten, die von der neuen Plug-in-Technologie des Unternehmens profitieren. Diese Busse kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen nicht nur durch den effizienten Bordgenerator wÃÂÃÂ¤hrend der Fahrt aufgeladen werden, sondern lassen sich auch an das Stromnetz anschlieÃÂÃÂen, was den Betreibern eine weitere MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeit zum Aufladen ihrer Busse bietet. Mit dem Series-ER-System kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen die Busse bis zu fÃÂÃÂ¼nf Kilometer (drei Meilen) am StÃÂÃÂ¼ck mit ausgeschaltetem Motor fahren. Diese Eigenschaft bietet StÃÂÃÂ¤dten und Gemeinden eine neue MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeit zur Verbesserung der LuftqualitÃÂÃÂ¤t. Zudem verbrauchen die Busse im Vergleich zu einem herkÃÂÃÂ¶mmlichen Bus bis zu 35 Prozent weniger Kraftstoff. ÃÂÃÂEine saubere Verkehrstechnologie in unseren StÃÂÃÂ¤dten ist unerlÃÂÃÂ¤sslich, wenn wir eine emissionsfreie Zukunft erreichen wollenÃÂÃÂ, sagte Ian Wilson, Director of Business Development in der Sparte Power & Propulsion Solutions bei BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂUnser System wird Irland dabei helfen, den nÃÂÃÂ¤chsten Schritt zur vollstÃÂÃÂ¤ndigen Elektrifizierung zu machen und die LuftqualitÃÂÃÂ¤t dort zu verbessern, wo die Menschen leben, arbeiten und zu Besuch sind.ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂÃÂDer Alexander Dennis Enviro400ER eignet sich optimal fÃÂÃÂ¼r flexible Einsatzanforderungen, wozu auch ein emissionsfreier Betrieb an Immissionsschwerpunkten gehÃÂÃÂ¶rtÃÂÃÂ, sagte Paul Davies, PrÃÂÃÂ¤sident und HauptgeschÃÂÃÂ¤ftsfÃÂÃÂ¼hrer von ADL. ÃÂÃÂDurch die MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeit, die Akkus extern zu laden, kann der Anteil der bordseitigen Stromerzeugung weiter reduziert werden. Diese neue Generation von Doppeldeckerbussen fÃÂÃÂ¼r Irland zeigt ein weiteres Mal, dass wir bei ADL mit unserem Augenmerk auf Innovation genau die Busse bauen, die unsere StÃÂÃÂ¤dte brauchen, um ihre Verkehrsprobleme zu lÃÂÃÂ¶sen.ÃÂÃÂ Das Busantriebssystem umfasst neben einer Elektromotor- und -generatoreinheit mit hohem Wirkungsgrad einen verbesserten Akku und eine intelligente elektronische Steuerung, die zusammen eine saubere Form des elektrischen Antriebs fÃÂÃÂ¼r die Busse ergeben. Es ermÃÂÃÂ¶glicht den Betreibern, die Vorteile des ÃÂÃÂkostroms aus dem Netz zu nutzen, und bereitet sie auf einen zukÃÂÃÂ¼nftigen rein elektrischen Betrieb vor. Die Betreiber kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen nun das Stromnetz nutzen - ÃÂÃÂ¤hnlich wie bei einem vollelektrischen Bus - und die BatteriekapazitÃÂÃÂ¤t erhÃÂÃÂ¶hen, um die Motorausschaltzeiten zu verlÃÂÃÂ¤ngern. In vielen FÃÂÃÂ¤llen wird dies bedeuten, dass eine ganze Strecke mit Netzstrom bedient werden kann, sofern die notwendige Ladeinfrastruktur vorhanden ist.

The pod-mounted RFCM system is a leading-edge, lightweight, high-power system that will add a new self-protection capability to this next-generation U.S. Navy aircraft. ÃÂÃÂThe ability to meet this unprecedented response time underscores our agility, focus on meeting customer needs, and our ultimate goal of protecting our warfighters,ÃÂÃÂ said Don Davidson, director of the Advanced Compact Electronic Warfare Solutions product line at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂA process that used to take 18 to 24 months has been scaled to five or six months, which is remarkable, as is deploying this new self-protection capability.ÃÂÃÂ The rapid response is the result of collaboration among small focus teams who developed an innovative approach to the design and fabrication of the systemÃÂÃÂs mechanical parts. As a result, BAE Systems will design, build, integrate, and ship the RFCM system in approximately five months, followed by two months of flight testing on the P-8A Poseidon platform. Testing will begin early in 2021. The RFCM system consists of a small form factor jammer, a high-powered amplifier and the AN/ALE-55 Fiber-Optic Towed Decoy.

The upgrade program with a new turret will vastly improve the vehicleÃÂÃÂs capabilities while providing crews with improved protection and ergonomics for increased combat efficiency. The new CV90 turret, developed by BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds in ÃÂÃÂrnskÃÂÃÂ¶ldsvik, Sweden, represents a leap forward in design and functionality. The main weapon position is changed to provide even better vehicle balance and enable new ways to introduce a variety of weaponry for increased lethality. It also offers significant ergonomic improvements to benefit the vehicleÃÂÃÂs crew. The enhanced turret design is built on years of combat-proven experience, continuous vehicle improvements, and data analysis from the CV90 User Club ÃÂÃÂ the seven nations currently operating CV90 fleets. The improvements are also based on a recent study conducted by the Royal Netherlands Army, and a BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ analysis of cognitive load on Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) crews to address man-machine interaction. The result gives crews increased advantages, such as the ability to choose intuitive and effective modes of operation as well as shorten the time to detection, identification, decision-making, and engagement. ÃÂÃÂThis is an important step to make sure that our Infantry Fighting Vehicles and our Army are well prepared for many years to come. This mid-life upgrade will also result in a lowering of the vehicles lifetime cost, at the same time as keeping our soldiers safe in the face of new threats,ÃÂÃÂ said Colonel Norbert Moerkens, the Royal Netherlands ArmyÃÂÃÂs head of strategy and plans. Work is already underway to equip the Dutch CV9035 vehicles with several enhanced capabilities such as an Active Protection System (APS) and Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), as well as a new Electro-Optic Aiming System (EOPS) which gives additional situation awareness. The latest upgrade also includes future-proofing the electronics by upgrading to the fourth generation digital backbone, with embedded and more robust cybersecurity. ÃÂÃÂWe are committed to delivering the most modern and adaptable IFVs to meet our customersÃÂÃÂ requirements and are extremely proud of the technological developments underway as part of this significant mid-life upgrade program,ÃÂÃÂ said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, managing director of BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. ÃÂÃÂWe look forward to supporting our Dutch customer increase its combat efficiency on the future battlefield.ÃÂÃÂ More than 20 Dutch companies are involved in the supply chain for the mid-life upgrade program to include mechanical and electrical components to BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds and the main subsystem suppliers, which will support the Dutch defense industrial base for many years to come. There are about 1,300 CV90s of numerous variants in service with Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

The fleet is the first in North America to benefit from the next-generation Series-EV zero emission technology. Series-EV eliminates the need for traditional combustion engines through the use of electric motors, controls, and batteries, creating a clean and efficient mode of transportation. The latest version of BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ technology uses fewer, lighter, and more compact components. Its light weight, reduced number of connections, and use of advanced materials make it easy to install and extremely efficient, enabling the buses to travel longer distances on a single charge. ÃÂÃÂThe deployment of clean transportation in our cities is critical to reach a zero emission future,ÃÂÃÂ said Steve Trichka, vice president and general manager of Power & Propulsion Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂOur Series-EV system will help Vancouver take a major step towards full electrification of its bus fleet, and will help to improve air quality throughout the city.ÃÂÃÂ BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ Series-EV system builds on more than 25 years of innovation and proven technology that powers buses around the world. The companyÃÂÃÂs all-electric systems are on buses in service throughout Europe, including cities such as London and Paris. BAE Systems has more than 13,000 propulsion systems in service on transit buses around the globe. Each year those systems contribute to a cleaner world by saving more than 28 million gallons of fuel and eliminating 313,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year across the globe ÃÂÃÂ the equivalent of taking 54,000 cars off the road or planting four million trees.

The contract signed with the Swedish military procurement agency, FMV, is for both command and control and logistics vehicles. Deliveries of the 127 vehicles are planned to begin in 2022 and complete in 2024. The vehicle can traverse rocks, mountains, snow, swamps, and Arctic environments, and its amphibious capability allows it to seamlessly transition to swimming. The BvS10ÃÂÃÂs flexible and modular design accommodates changing mission requirements, including advanced battle management. Sweden already operates the BvS10 as well as its predecessor Bv206, and adding more BvS10s to the fleet will increase the ArmyÃÂÃÂs ability to carry out its mission. ÃÂÃÂThe investment from Sweden provides the Swedish Army with more of these extremely mobile, capable and robust vehicles. This continued investment in the BvS10 is an important step toward further opportunities in Sweden and internationally for the BvS10 and its Beowulf unarmored variant,ÃÂÃÂ said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, managing director of BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. ÃÂÃÂThis also demonstrates the strong and trusted relationship between BAE Systems and the Swedish customer to deliver the capabilities the Swedish military needs.ÃÂÃÂ The Swedish BvS10s feature enhanced crew ergonomics, greater internal volume, and advanced protection, building on BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ legacy Bv206 vehicles, of which more than 10,000 have been sold to more than 40 countries. The BvS10 has been deployed for missions to Afghanistan, Central Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. ÃÂÃÂWe see an increased interest from many countries for extreme mobility capabilities, such as those seen on our BvS10 and Beowulf platforms. We are especially looking forward to the joint four-nations collaborative all-terrain procurement involving Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom,ÃÂÃÂ added Gustafsson-Rask. Today Austria, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are operators of the BvS10.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005194/en/Sweden-Adding-to-BvS10-Fleet-Ordering-127-More-of-the-All-Terrain-Vehicles,businesswire.com,5,rnskldsvik swedenbusiness wirebae system signed contract worth around million produce deliver bvs allterrain vehicle swedish army adding existing fleet bvss contract signed swedish military procurement agency fmv command control logistics vehicle delivery vehicle planned begin complete vehicle traverse rock mountain snow swamp arctic environment amphibious capability allows seamlessly transition swimming bvss flexible modular design accommodates changing mission requirement including advanced battle management sweden already operates bvs well predecessor bv adding bvss fleet increase army ability carry mission investment sweden provides swedish army extremely mobile capable robust vehicle continued investment bvs important step toward opportunity sweden internationally bvs beowulf unarmored variant said tommy gustafssonrask managing director bae system hgglunds also demonstrates strong trusted relationship bae system swedish customer deliver capability swedish military need swedish bvss feature enhanced crew ergonomics greater internal volume advanced protection building bae system legacy bv vehicle sold country bvs deployed mission afghanistan central africa balkan middle east see increased interest many country extreme mobility capability seen bvs beowulf platform especially looking forward joint fournations collaborative allterrain procurement involving germany netherlands sweden united kingdom added gustafssonrask today austria france netherlands sweden united kingdom operator bvs,0.9879,0.49395,0.43678,0.05717,Positive Impact

Designed by BAE Systems and manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIESÃÂÃÂ® (GFÃÂÃÂ®), the RAD510 SoC will be the core of a single board computer (SBC) with twice the performance capability of the industry standard RAD750ÃÂÃÂ® microprocessor. The new SBC will provide Power ArchitectureÃÂÃÂ® software-compatible processing that is more advanced than the RAD750 radiation-hardened general purpose processor, while demanding less power from its spacecraft. ÃÂÃÂThe RAD510 SBC is the natural evolution of our RAD750 heritage microprocessor-based SBC, which has powered many of the most important national space assets,ÃÂÃÂ said Ricardo Gonzalez, director of Space Systems at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂThese high-reliability computers increase performance capability for satellites and other spacecraft, making space missions more effective. BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ relationship with GLOBALFOUNDRIES began in 2001 with the development of the highly successful RH25 semiconductor technology node.ÃÂÃÂ The RAD510 SoC is already being integrated into SBCs that will be available to space agencies and spacecraft manufacturers this year. For ease of transition, the software is compatible with both the RAD750 and RAD5545 computers. The BAE Systems family of space-based electronics can withstand radiation doses a million times stronger than a fatal human dose; that durability is valued on missions like GPS III, Mars rovers, and many satellites on-orbit today. The RAD510 SBC also requires less power and has the radiation advantages of RH45 45nm silicon-on-isolator (SOI) technology. ÃÂÃÂWe are proud to work with BAE Systems and leverage the performance, reliability, and energy efficiency of our 45nm semiconductor platform to meet the stringent requirements of space,ÃÂÃÂ said Mike Hogan, senior vice president and general manager of Automotive, Industrial and Multi-market at GF. ÃÂÃÂAs the industry leader in semiconductors for sensitive aerospace and defense applications, GF knows what it takes to develop and manufacture solutions requiring the highest levels of security.ÃÂÃÂ BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ facility in Manassas, Va. is a U.S. Department of Defense Category 1A Microelectronics Trusted Source. The companyÃÂÃÂs radiation-hardened electronics have been on-board satellites and spacecraft for almost 30 years, delivering long-lasting computing power in extreme environments. The RAD510 SoCs are manufactured at GFÃÂÃÂs Fab 10 facility in East Fishkill, N.Y., also a U.S. Department of Defense Category 1A Microelectronics Trusted Source. GF and BAE Systems have initiated the process of transitioning the manufacturing of 45 nm SOI technology to GFÃÂÃÂs most advanced facility, Fab 8 in Malta, N.Y., making it available to the space community in the future. BAE Systems also offers a suite of radiation-hardened Serial RapidIO network products which complement the RAD510 SBC and allow the user to efficiently manage and route data through the system. These include the RADNETÃÂÃÂ® 1848-PS, an 18-Port RapidIO Packet Switch, the RADNET 1616-XP Crosspoint, a protocol agnostic SerDes signal circuit switch and replicator, and the RADNET SRIO-EP, a Serial RapidIO endpoint.

In partnership with state-owned defense integrator VOP CZ s.p., the teamÃÂÃÂs offer will ensure the production and delivery of the CV90 MkIV Infantry Fighting Vehicle on schedule and to budget, as well as support the sovereignty of the Czech Army and Czech industry in the service and future development of the vehicle. BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds, the manufacturer of the CV90, has delivered multiple CV90 export programs to European customers. The teamÃÂÃÂs highly successful and proven industrial cooperation approach is closely aligned to the Czech RepublicÃÂÃÂs industrial aspirations, including the co-development and delivery of tracked combat vehicles with VOP CZ s.p.. BAE Systems also has arrangements with more than 30 state- and privately-owned companies, as well as ongoing and planned future collaboration with Czech Academia including the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU). ÃÂÃÂWe are confident that the advanced capabilities of the offered CV90 MkIV is the best choice for the Czech Army, to protect its soldiers and secure the future of its nationÃÂÃÂs defense forces as well its defense industry,ÃÂÃÂ said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, managing director of BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. ÃÂÃÂBAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ successful industrial cooperation goes beyond the mechanical assembly of the vehicle or the creation of new factories. Our offering is based on Czech defense industries playing a high-value and strategic role in the development, production, training, and support of the vehicle and all its variants.ÃÂÃÂ The CV90 MkIV offer also includes the most recent turret configuration designed to provide increased capabilities through the integration of the latest generation of sensors and active survivability systems, added weapon capabilities, and enhanced crew and squad ergonomics. Built on combat-proven experience and data analysis from the CV90ÃÂÃÂs seven existing users, the improved CV90 MkIV turret also reduces cognitive load on crews through greater use of A.I. to meet the growing needs of the modern battlefield. ÃÂÃÂWe believe our strategic relationship with VOP CZ s.p., combined with the modern, combat-proven CV90 MkIV, is the right formula for a successful program in the Czech Republic,ÃÂÃÂ concluded Gustafsson-Rask. The CV90 is in operation with seven nations: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. With close to 1,300 CV90s of numerous variants in service, the vehicle has a combat-proven track record and is designed to accommodate future growth to meet evolving missions.

Working across two separate projects in the city with Uber Boat by Thames Clippers, a ferry operator, and Cory, a waste to energy management company, BAE Systems will use its expertise in providing integrated solutions in electric propulsion and power management, alongside its experience in vessel autonomy. This approach will deliver connected solutions to reduce the power demands of vessels, in conjunction with their design, to increase efficiency. The projects will also look at how onboard and shore based high power, rapid charging points can be developed to provide charging stations for vessels to keep on the move. These two projects are part of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition, funded by the Department for Transport and delivered by Innovate UK. Each project will start as a feasibility study that will show the technological and commercial viability of connected system designs. ÃÂÃÂThe UK government has set robust targets for nationwide net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we all have a part to play to achieve that ambition, but we canÃÂÃÂt do this on our own,ÃÂÃÂ said Paul Simavari, Business Development Manager for BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ Electronic Systems sector. ÃÂÃÂThe Clean Maritime Demonstrators are an exciting new approach to the Zero Emissions challenge and by bringing together companies with expertise across the industry, we will be able to create a cleaner, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly marine sector.ÃÂÃÂ Uber Boat by Thames Clippers operates 21 vessels along the River Thames, providing links across the city for commuters and tourists. This project will investigate how low- and zero-emission propulsion and power management technology, which includes intelligent controls, can make a positive difference in transporting people and goods around a busy capital city. Geoff Symonds, Chief Operating Officer for Uber Boat by Thames Clippers said: ÃÂÃÂAs the operator of a modern and fuel-efficient high speed passenger boat service on the River Thames, we are, and have been for over 20 years, at the forefront of innovation for the river marine sector. We are committed to supporting the sustainable growth of infrastructure on and around the river to ensure its long-term importance to Greater London. We pride ourselves on driving the technology forward to ensure we are continually working to improve both the efficiency and environmental impact of our business. As such, we are proud to be working alongside BAE Systems to achieve a greener marine future.ÃÂÃÂ The second, separate study with Cory, the only UK recycling and waste management company to transport waste by river, will look at how low and zero-emission propulsion and power management technology, combined with autonomous capabilities can bring cleaner energy to the waste management industry. Cory already turns waste into construction materials and a clean source of energy that feeds back into LondonÃÂÃÂs main power grid and that could potentially supply Thames River users. CoryÃÂÃÂs Director of Logistics, Fran Comerford-Cole, said: ÃÂÃÂCoryÃÂÃÂs collaboration with BAE Systems is an important, coordinated effort to reduce shipping emissions and explore the potential of autonomous propulsion. As a business, we are proud of our stewardship of the Thames and the riverÃÂÃÂs role in reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We want to take this a step further by helping to drive innovation in lower and zero carbon marine vessels. In turn, this will help the UK on its road ÃÂÃÂ or voyage ÃÂÃÂ to net zero.ÃÂÃÂ The Clean Maritime Energy Competition will expand BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ existing clean energy footprint in London, with engine drive technology already featuring on nearly 1,000 of the cityÃÂÃÂs iconic red buses. These two feasibility studies will start this month and will be completed by March 2022. The aim is then to produce vessel demonstrators for each project to prove the findings of the study before being adopted by the wider fleet.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210916005158/en/BAE-Systems-Expands-Its-Clean-Energy-Footprint-With-Two-New-Projects-for-Maritime-Sector,businesswire.com,5,london rochester englandbusiness wirebae system collaboration maritime industry leader secured funding uk department transport design develop demonstrate exciting new power propulsion technology london potential reduce emission across global waterway working across two separate project city uber boat thames clipper ferry operator cory waste energy management company bae system use expertise providing integrated solution electric propulsion power management alongside experience vessel autonomy approach deliver connected solution reduce power demand vessel conjunction design increase efficiency project also look onboard shore based high power rapid charging point developed provide charging station vessel keep move two project part clean maritime demonstration competition funded department transport delivered innovate uk project start feasibility study show technological commercial viability connected system design uk government set robust target nationwide net zero carbon emission part play achieve ambition cant said paul simavari business development manager bae system electronic system sector clean maritime demonstrator exciting new approach zero emission challenge bringing together company expertise across industry able create cleaner sustainable environmentally friendly marine sector uber boat thames clipper operates vessel along river thames providing link across city commuter tourist project investigate low zeroemission propulsion power management technology includes intelligent control make positive difference transporting people good around busy capital city geoff symonds chief operating officer uber boat thames clipper said operator modern fuelefficient high speed passenger boat service river thames year forefront innovation river marine sector committed supporting sustainable growth infrastructure around river ensure longterm importance greater london pride driving technology forward ensure continually working improve efficiency environmental impact business proud working alongside bae system achieve greener marine future second separate study cory uk recycling waste management company transport waste river look low zeroemission propulsion power management technology combined autonomous capability bring cleaner energy waste management industry cory already turn waste construction material clean source energy feed back london main power grid could potentially supply thames river user corys director logistics fran comerfordcole said corys collaboration bae system important coordinated effort reduce shipping emission explore potential autonomous propulsion business proud stewardship thames river role reducing environmental impact operation want take step helping drive innovation lower zero carbon marine vessel turn help uk road voyage net zero clean maritime energy competition expand bae system existing clean energy footprint london engine drive technology already featuring nearly city iconic red bus two feasibility study start month completed march aim produce vessel demonstrator project prove finding study adopted wider fleet,0.9978,0.4989,0.1749,0.324,Positive Impact

The main goal of the program is to expand onshore access to state-of-the-art microelectronics technology for the United States government and aerospace community. Currently, this type of technology is available through limited sources in the U.S. This leads to supply chain challenges and time lags for the delivery of next-generation microelectronics designed for environmentally rugged missions like those occurring in space. With this contract, BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST LabsTM research and development organization will harness IntelÃÂÃÂs commercial foundry process to build a new design library that can be used to develop advanced, high-reliability microelectronics and expand the domestic supply of this technology for the defense and aerospace community. ÃÂÃÂRadiation hardened electronics are highly specialized mission critical technology,ÃÂÃÂ said Chris Rappa, director at BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST Labs. ÃÂÃÂLeveraging IntelÃÂÃÂs commercial foundry to manufacture this technology can speed up the production of next-generation technology and help resolve supply chain challenges so we can maintain our countryÃÂÃÂs technological edge.ÃÂÃÂ This award opens a roadmap for the U.S. defense and aerospace community to access more advanced process nodes for the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Currently, development of RHBD ASICs uses a 45nm process, but with this contract there is potential to deploy more advanced technology nodes and enable more functionality and faster processing in smaller areas, at lower power. In addition to working with Intel Foundry Services, BAE Systems will execute on this program through collaboration with a team composed of Cadence Design Systems, Carnegie Mellon University, Movellus, Reliable MicroSystems, and Sandia National Laboratories. This work builds on the companyÃÂÃÂs longstanding heritage of delivering electronics capable of successfully completing missions in the most challenging environments. BAE Systems will perform work on the program at its facilities in Merrimack, N.H. and Manassas, Va.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220119005087/en/BAE-Systems-Awarded-a-60-Million-Contract-to-Expand-Domestic-Supply-of-State-of-the-art-Microelectronics-Technology,businesswire.com,5,merrimack nhbusiness wirebae system awarded million contract army contracting command rock island cornerstone transaction authority develop certain type nextgeneration radiation hardened design rhbd microelectronics leveraging intel corporation commercial foundry intel foundry service main goal program expand onshore access stateoftheart microelectronics technology united state government aerospace community currently type technology available limited source u lead supply chain challenge time lag delivery nextgeneration microelectronics designed environmentally rugged mission like occurring space contract bae system fast labstm research development organization harness intels commercial foundry process build new design library used develop advanced highreliability microelectronics expand domestic supply technology defense aerospace community radiation hardened electronics highly specialized mission critical technology said chris rappa director bae system fast lab leveraging intels commercial foundry manufacture technology speed production nextgeneration technology help resolve supply chain challenge maintain country technological edge award open roadmap u defense aerospace community access advanced process node development application specific integrated circuit asic currently development rhbd asics us nm process contract potential deploy advanced technology node enable functionality faster processing smaller area lower power addition working intel foundry service bae system execute program collaboration team composed cadence design system carnegie mellon university movellus reliable microsystems sandia national laboratory work build company longstanding heritage delivering electronics capable successfully completing mission challenging environment bae system perform work program facility merrimack nh manassas va,0.9833,0.49165,0.1510166667,0.3406333333,Positive Impact

Reliable data and communications networks are critical in modern warfare. Currently, no capability exists to dynamically control interconnected networks and ensure that warfighters can communicate across domains in contested environments. The MINC program seeks to build and demonstrate an integrated, advanced capability that creates a secure communications network to support multi-domain operations. Under the terms of the contract, BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST LabsÃÂÃÂ research and development organization will develop the algorithms and software to anticipate, configure, and control available resources to optimize the flow of information. ÃÂÃÂIn todayÃÂÃÂs highly congested and contested environments, secure and adaptable multi-domain communications have never been more important,ÃÂÃÂ said Brian Decleene, chief scientist at BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST Labs.

SABER is the backbone of Compass Call, a next-generation electromagnetic attack weapon system that disrupts enemy command and control communications, radar, and navigation systems. The test flights demonstrated the technologyÃÂÃÂs agility in delivering advanced electromagnetic warfare capabilities to Compass Call. ÃÂÃÂBAE Systems has been keeping Compass Call ahead of the curve as its prime mission system contractor for more than 20 years,ÃÂÃÂ said Jared Belinsky, director of Electronic Attack Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂWeÃÂÃÂre continuously developing technology to help dominate the electromagnetic spectrum and keep our military service members safe.ÃÂÃÂ The hallmark of SABER is its open system architecture that enables the rapid integration of new technology through software updates instead of hardware reconfiguration. It also allows for multiple system upgrades to counter emerging threats. The U.S. Air Force Compass Call Test Team, with support from BAE Systems, tested the new applications. BAE Systems integrated the applications with a non-proprietary SABER software development kit. The successful flight test is leading to fielding of the SABER capability on the EC-130H. The EC-130H Compass Call mission system is currently being transferred to the Gulfstream G550 business jet, designated the EC-37B.

This follows an order of 165 additional Series-ER (Electric Range) systems for nearby Mississauga Transit (MiWay), supplying Ontario transit agencies with next-generation technology to reduce fuel use and enable infrastructure-free zero emissions operations across its fleets. BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ Series-ER system offers significant zero emission capabilities to assist a transit agencyÃÂÃÂs transition to a full zero-emission operation. Series-ER features the companyÃÂÃÂs next-generation components that use advanced materials and a lightweight, compact design to increase electrical efficiency. The Ontario fleet orders extend the footprint of the companyÃÂÃÂs technology to more than 15,000 transit buses worldwide. ÃÂÃÂWe are continuing to support TTC and MiWay with clean technology that advances our shared commitment to sustainable transportation,ÃÂÃÂ said Steve Trichka, vice president and general manager of Power & Propulsion Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂOur electric drive system provides transit agencies with a reliable, efficient, and innovative solution for fleets to continue on the path to zero emissions.ÃÂÃÂ The Series-ER system includes an electric motor, onboard energy storage, and smart controls to create a clean, integrated electric propulsion and accessory power system for the buses. In addition, the buses will feature BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ proven engine stop and start function and geofencing technology, allowing an electric-hybrid bus to automatically switch to full electric bus mode when entering designated green zones. The system uses advanced energy recovery and an onboard charger to further deliver zero-emissions operation without the need for grid-connected charging. BAE Systems has 25 years of experience developing and fielding electric propulsion systems and accessories for transit buses. The companyÃÂÃÂs Series-ER technology is part of that foundation, helping transit agencies bridge the gap to zero emissions, without infrastructure requirements for vehicle charging. The production and service support for the Series-ER systems will be conducted at the companyÃÂÃÂs facility in Endicott, N.Y.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220601005268/en/BAE-Systems-to-Provide-More-Than-500-Electric-Drive-Systems-for-Ontario-Bus-Fleets,businesswire.com,5,toronto endicott nybusiness wirebae system leader electric propulsion selected toronto transit commission ttc provide electric drive system new fleet zeroemission capable hybrid transit bus follows order additional serieser electric range system nearby mississauga transit miway supplying ontario transit agency nextgeneration technology reduce fuel use enable infrastructurefree zero emission operation across fleet bae system serieser system offer significant zero emission capability assist transit agency transition full zeroemission operation serieser feature company nextgeneration component use advanced material lightweight compact design increase electrical efficiency ontario fleet order extend footprint company technology transit bus worldwide continuing support ttc miway clean technology advance shared commitment sustainable transportation said steve trichka vice president general manager power propulsion solution bae system electric drive system provides transit agency reliable efficient innovative solution fleet continue path zero emission serieser system includes electric motor onboard energy storage smart control create clean integrated electric propulsion accessory power system bus addition bus feature bae system proven engine stop start function geofencing technology allowing electrichybrid bus automatically switch full electric bus mode entering designated green zone system us advanced energy recovery onboard charger deliver zeroemissions operation without need gridconnected charging bae system year experience developing fielding electric propulsion system accessory transit bus company serieser technology part foundation helping transit agency bridge gap zero emission without infrastructure requirement vehicle charging production service support serieser system conducted company facility endicott ny,0.9912,0.4956,0.2607,0.2349,Positive Impact

BvS10: BvS10 is an armored all-terrain vehicle ideal for operations in Arctic and cold weather environments. It can traverse ice, steep mountains, and rocks, and its amphibious capability allows it to swim while operating in some of the most remote areas the planet has to offer. Its modular design allows it to be reconfigured for varying missions. The Swedish Army recently ordered 127 BvS10s and it is also under consideration for the European joint acquisition program for the Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CATV) program. Its sister vehicle, the unarmored Beowulf, is under consideration for the U.S. ArmyÃÂÃÂs CATV program. ARCHER: ARCHER is a wheeled mobile 155mm howitzer capable of initiating fire within 30 seconds of receiving an order and can depart its position in the same amount of time, giving it superior ÃÂÃÂshoot and scootÃÂÃÂ capability by minimizing the enemyÃÂÃÂs ability to effectively return fire. Its automated ammunition magazine stows 21 rounds, and which can be fired in less than three minutes. With guided munitions it can reach targets in excess of 50km. 360 MVP SensorÃÂÃÂ: The 360 MVP SensorÃÂÃÂ system improves ground vehiclesÃÂÃÂ situational awareness, reduces crew cognitive load, and integrates easily with other vehicle protection system features ÃÂÃÂ all to enhance crew response time, survivability, and mission success. It is comprised of high-definition, extended-view sensors built with BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ 1920x1200 longwave infrared camera cores, the 360 MVP SensorÃÂÃÂ system delivers low-latency imagery during the day, at night, in adverse weather, and in challenging natural and manmade battlefield conditions. Check6ÃÂÃÂ: The Check-6ÃÂÃÂ rear-vision system is a camera system for ground vehicles that provides high-quality situational awareness to ground forces. The plug and play system utilizes a qualified, uncooled, infrared camera core that is embedded into U.S. Department of Defense taillights. With a universal fit for all U.S. ground vehicles, Check-6 does not require a custom mount or armor holes. This innovative solution provides a streamlined path for vehicle installation that can be accomplished as a field-upgrade kit, allowing for minimal vehicle downtime. APKWSÃÂÃÂ® laser-guidance kit: The APKWS guidance kit transforms an unguided 2.75-inch (70 millimeter) rocket into a precision-guided rocket that gives military aircraft and ground vehicles a low-cost surgical strike capability. In combat, the APKWS system has achieved over a 93 percent success rate when fired from rotary- and fixed-wing platforms. APKWS laser-guidance kits are used by four branches of the U.S. military, and are available to allied nations for ongoing combat operations via Foreign Military Sales (FMS).",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607005393/en/BAE-Systems-to-showcase-combat-vehicles-and-advanced-defense-technologies-during-Eurosatory,businesswire.com,5,parisbusiness wirebae system display broad range capability eurosatory defense security tradeshow paris june including combat vehicle artillery system technology precision strike situational awareness full size vehicle display outdoor stand c area pea cvmkiv infantry fighting vehicle recently selected slovakia ministry defence preferred system procurement infantry fighting vehicle ifvs slovak army archer mm mobile howitzer bvs allterrain vehicle along advanced guided weapon system situational awareness technology cv cv combat proven trusted exists dozen variant different mission set use seven country interoperable nato force cvmkiv latest version tracked ifv advanced digitized solution situational awareness targeting integrated antitank guided missile active protection system increased survivability bvs bvs armored allterrain vehicle ideal operation arctic cold weather environment traverse ice steep mountain rock amphibious capability allows swim operating remote area planet offer modular design allows reconfigured varying mission swedish army recently ordered bvss also consideration european joint acquisition program cold weather allterrain vehicle catv program sister vehicle unarmored beowulf consideration u army catv program archer archer wheeled mobile mm howitzer capable initiating fire within second receiving order depart position amount time giving superior shoot scoot capability minimizing enemy ability effectively return fire automated ammunition magazine stows round fired less three minute guided munition reach target excess km mvp sensor mvp sensor system improves ground vehicle situational awareness reduces crew cognitive load integrates easily vehicle protection system feature enhance crew response time survivability mission success comprised highdefinition extendedview sensor built bae system x longwave infrared camera core mvp sensor system delivers lowlatency imagery day night adverse weather challenging natural manmade battlefield condition check check rearvision system camera system ground vehicle provides highquality situational awareness ground force plug play system utilizes qualified uncooled infrared camera core embedded u department defense taillight universal fit u ground vehicle check require custom mount armor hole innovative solution provides streamlined path vehicle installation accomplished fieldupgrade kit allowing minimal vehicle downtime apkws laserguidance kit apkws guidance kit transforms unguided inch millimeter rocket precisionguided rocket give military aircraft ground vehicle lowcost surgical strike capability combat apkws system achieved percent success rate fired rotary fixedwing platform apkws laserguidance kit used four branch u military available allied nation ongoing combat operation via foreign military sale fm,0.9686,0.4843,0.185575,0.298725,Positive Impact

This test marked the first time an APKWS laser-guided rocket has ever been fired from a robotic combat vehicle (RCV). The autonomous RTD meets the ArmyÃÂÃÂs needs for a RCV medium solution. Multi-mission capable, the RTD has a commercially-proven hybrid electric drive and can be equipped with various advanced payloads such as electronic warfare sensors, various gun systems, anti-tank guided missiles and 2.75ÃÂÃÂ rockets with BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ APKWSÃÂÃÂ® laser-guidance kit. The vehicle also can be fitted with loitering munitions to defeat armored and unmanned aerial threats. ÃÂÃÂOver the past year, weÃÂÃÂve partnered with leading technology companies to build an autonomous vehicle that will exceed the ArmyÃÂÃÂs RCV medium requirements,ÃÂÃÂ said Helen Park, Future Tech Works director at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂThis successful demonstration proves that our unmanned vehicle can be integrated and updated with cutting-edge technology, payloads, and weapon systems to support multiple mission sets and deliver advanced capability in a multi-domain operational environment.ÃÂÃÂ Ground-launched APKWS rockets provide mounted units with a unique capability to engage ground targets and unmanned aerial vehicles at ranges up to six kilometers. This provides warfighters with a cost-effective solution for precision strike with greater range than small arms fire and without the need for air support. Future Tech Works (FTX) is a new organization within BAE Systems that works closely with engineering experts and customers to identify, develop, and test solutions for the defense needs of the future. FTX reimagines the battlefield to modernize and deliver technologies that help keep service members safer, more agile, and ready to tackle any threat.

Under a contract with U.S. Space Systems Command, BAE Systems is delivering its Miniature Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver Engine ÃÂÃÂ M-Code (MPE-M), providing precise geolocation and positioning capabilities in complex and contested operational environments for ground-based soldiers and vehicles and other space-constrained applications. BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ MPE-M is a small, high-performance GPS receiver providing assured Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) for applications where size, weight, and power are all critical factors, including handheld devices, ground vehicles, and unmanned aerial systems. ÃÂÃÂGermany is the first country to receive M-Code GPS capabilities via FMS, leading the way among our allies,ÃÂÃÂ said Greg Wild, director of Navigation and Sensor Systems at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂAccelerating the delivery of M-Code capabilities to allied warfighters around the globe is critical to ensuring trusted PNT in the face of modern threats from our adversaries.ÃÂÃÂ MPE-M acquires signals rapidly, and is compatible with the advanced military M-Code GPS signal, which is hardened against signal jamming and spoofing and provides next-generation cryptography for improved security. The receiver has the same form factor as its predecessor, accelerating and simplifying the M-Code upgrade process for existing military GPS user equipment and accommodating future growth and changes in GPS operational needs. Work on BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ military GPS products is conducted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where the company is building a modern engineering and production facility. The companyÃÂÃÂs Navigation and Sensor Systems business has delivered thousands of M-Code GPS receivers to the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S.-based systems integrators, and more than 1.5 million GPS devices globally.

The guidance is based on the measures used to monitor the underlying financial performance of the Group.

We monitor the underlying financial performance of the Group using alternative performance measures. These measures are not defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. Accordingly, the relevant IFRS measures are also presented where appropriate. For alternative performance measure definitions see glossary on page 9. 2. International Financial Reporting Standards. 3. A one-off tax benefit of ÃÂÃÂ£94m was recognised in 2021, in respect of agreements reached regarding the exposure arising from the April 2019 European Commission decision regarding the UKÃÂÃÂs Controlled Foreign Company regime.

The delivery paves the way for developmental and operational flight testing of the Baseline 3 configuration of Compass Call in January 2023. Baseline 3 offers additional electronic warfare capabilities. Interim fielding is expected to follow the completion of testing by mid-2024. ÃÂÃÂSince the programÃÂÃÂs inception, BAE Systems has consistently delivered advanced capabilities for Compass Call,ÃÂÃÂ said Jared Belinsky, director of Electronic Attack Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂThis final hardware delivery for the first EC-37B aircraft ensures an upgrade that will continue to outpace our adversaries.ÃÂÃÂ Compass Call is being redesigned from the current EC-130H airframe model to the enhanced flight performance of a commercial business jet airframe known as the EC-37B. It is the Department of DefenseÃÂÃÂs only long range, full-spectrum stand-off electronic warfare jamming platform. Compass Call disrupts enemy command and control communications, radar, and navigation systems to restrict battlespace coordination. It suppresses air defenses by preventing the transmission of essential information between adversaries, their weapon systems, and control networks. BAE Systems also recently successfully tested three third-party applications on Compass CallÃÂÃÂs Small Adaptive Bank of Electronic Resource (SABER) technology. The hallmark of SABER is its open system architecture that enables the rapid integration of new technology through software updates instead of hardware reconfiguration. This allows for the rapid insertion of new capabilities to keep pace with emerging technologies.

Customers, local dignitaries, and BAE Systems employees attended the event, which celebrated the first vehicle completed in the 500 million euro upgrade program. The upgrade enhances the CV90 vehiclesÃÂÃÂ capabilities by providing vehicle crews with improved protection, firepower, and ergonomics, and significantly increased combat effectiveness. ÃÂÃÂThis rollout is an important step in the mid-life update of the infantry fighting vehicles for the Royal Netherlands Army,ÃÂÃÂ said Vice Admiral Arie Jan de Waard, the National Armaments Director, and director of the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO). ÃÂÃÂThe upgrade of the CV90 results in a state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicle which provides more protection, a new turret, greater firepower, and a new IT infrastructure. The vehicle enhances crew operational effectiveness when facing new threats and keeping our infantry safe at the same time. It is a powerful combination of man and machine. The 122 upgraded Dutch CV90s will be futureproof,ÃÂÃÂ he added. The Dutch CV9035 vehicles have been equipped with several enhanced capabilities such as an Active Protection System (APS), an Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM), and a new Electro-Optic Aiming System (EOPS), which provides additional situational awareness. The vehicles also include an upgraded fourth generation digital backbone, with embedded and more robust cybersecurity, to future-proof the electronics. ÃÂÃÂWe are committed to delivering the most modern and adaptable IFVs to meet our customersÃÂÃÂ requirements, and we are extremely proud of the technological developments underway as part of this significant mid-life upgrade program,ÃÂÃÂ said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, managing director of BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. ÃÂÃÂThis is the first step in delivering the IFV that meets our Dutch customerÃÂÃÂs needs, increasing their combat efficiency on the future battlefield.ÃÂÃÂ In January 2021, BAE Systems signed an extensive mid-life upgrade contract with the Dutch Defence Materiel Organization (DMO) for the Royal Netherlands ArmyÃÂÃÂs fleet of 122 CV90s, to ensure the CV9035NL remains in service through 2039. A key improvement is the newly-designed CV90 turret, a leap forward in capability and functionality, developed by BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. The main weapon position has been changed, resulting in even better vehicle balance, as well as creating new options for alternative solutions for both weaponry and crew, including significantly improved lethality and ergonomics. More than 20 Dutch companies are involved in the supply chain for the mid-life upgrade program, providing mechanical and electrical components to both BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds and its main subsystem suppliers. These relationships will support the Dutch defense industrial base for many years to come.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221011005506/en/BAE-Systems-Delivers-Upgraded-CV90-With-Brand-New-Turret-to-the-Netherlands,businesswire.com,5,rnskldsvik swedenbusiness wirethe first newlyupgraded cv infantry fighting vehicle ifvs royal netherlands army fleet recently unveiled rollout ceremony bae system hgglunds facility sweden customer local dignitary bae system employee attended event celebrated first vehicle completed million euro upgrade program upgrade enhances cv vehicle capability providing vehicle crew improved protection firepower ergonomics significantly increased combat effectiveness rollout important step midlife update infantry fighting vehicle royal netherlands army said vice admiral arie jan de waard national armament director director defence materiel organisation dmo upgrade cv result stateoftheart infantry fighting vehicle provides protection new turret greater firepower new infrastructure vehicle enhances crew operational effectiveness facing new threat keeping infantry safe time powerful combination man machine upgraded dutch cv futureproof added dutch cv vehicle equipped several enhanced capability active protection system aps antitank guided missile atgm new electrooptic aiming system eops provides additional situational awareness vehicle also include upgraded fourth generation digital backbone embedded robust cybersecurity futureproof electronics committed delivering modern adaptable ifvs meet customer requirement extremely proud technological development underway part significant midlife upgrade program said tommy gustafssonrask managing director bae system hgglunds first step delivering ifv meet dutch customer need increasing combat efficiency future battlefield january bae system signed extensive midlife upgrade contract dutch defence materiel organization dmo royal netherlands army fleet cv ensure cvnl remains service key improvement newlydesigned cv turret leap forward capability functionality developed bae system hgglunds main weapon position changed resulting even better vehicle balance well creating new option alternative solution weaponry crew including significantly improved lethality ergonomics dutch company involved supply chain midlife upgrade program providing mechanical electrical component bae system hgglunds main subsystem supplier relationship support dutch defense industrial base many year come,0.988,0.494,0.0930225,0.4009775,Positive Impact

Guided by APKWS guidance kits, the rockets went three for three against armored targets, demonstrating their versatility to engage a broad set of targets and enable new missions for warfighters. APKWS guidance kits transform unguided rockets into smart munitions for precision strikes on soft targets, equipment, and armored targets. During the test event, BAE Systems launched rockets with HEAT/APAM warheads and APKWS guidance kits against well-armored targets ÃÂÃÂ including a steel plate and an armored military vehicle. All test shots were direct hits, defeating fortified targets at range. The HEAT/APAM warheads are capable of penetrating thick armor, which improves the versatility of rockets guided by APKWS guidance kits. ÃÂÃÂWeÃÂÃÂre giving our customers more in-mission options for precision strikes against tougher targets,ÃÂÃÂ said Sam Kirsh, APKWS program manager at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂAPKWS guidance kits with HEAT/APAM warheads provide a low-cost, lightweight, easy-to-deploy strike capability against armored and unarmored targets.ÃÂÃÂ The APKWS guidance kits are also compatible with 2.75ÃÂÃÂ (70 millimeter) Hydra rocket components ÃÂÃÂ including new and existing inventories of motors, warheads, fuses, launchers, and laser target designators. They require minimal training to assemble and fire, and can be fired from a variety of launch platforms, including fighter jets, combat helicopters, ground vehicles, and remote weapon stations. APKWS guidance kits have proven their accuracy in combat with hundreds of successful shots fired with the M151 high-explosive warhead. The guidance kit is available to allied nations via Foreign Military Sales.

During the demonstration in Southern Arizona, five APKWS-guided counter-UAS rockets were fired from a containerized weapon system and destroyed all targets, including fast-moving drones. The test results further demonstrate APKWS guidance kitsÃÂÃÂ ability to enable low-cost, precision strikes against airborne threats. ÃÂÃÂMilitarized drones are becoming more prevalent in conflicts around the world, and weÃÂÃÂre giving our customers an efficient way to counter them without wasting expensive missiles,ÃÂÃÂ said Greg Procopio, director of Precision Guidance and Sensing Solutions at BAE Systems. ÃÂÃÂOur tests demonstrate that APKWS guidance kits have the flexibility to engage a variety of targets to meet the evolving mission needs of the warfighter.ÃÂÃÂ The 70mm rockets can destroy Class-2 aerial drones by combining standard motors and warheads with APKWS guidance kits and proven proximity/point-detonation fuzes. The resulting precision munition is a low-cost, supersonic, lock-on-after-launch strike weapon with a large 10-pound warhead that can destroy large drones in a matter of seconds with or without direct contact. Combat-proven APKWS-guided rockets are highly effective against a variety of soft and armored stationary and moving targets. They can be fired by many different platforms, including jets, helicopters, trucks, boats, and weapon stations, and stowed APKWS guidance kits protect seeker optics from adjacent rocket fire, unlike nose-mounted seeker optics. APKWS guidance kits are the only U.S. government program of record for 70mm laser-guided rockets. The kits are available to all U.S. armed forces, as well as U.S. allies via Foreign Military Sales. APKWS guidance kits are produced at BAE Systems manufacturing facilities in Hudson, New Hampshire and Austin, Texas.

The approximately $30 million contract has been awarded to the BAE Systems Swedish joint venture HB Utveckling AB, which combines BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds and Bofors manufacturing capabilities. Production will be performed at BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds in ÃÂÃÂrnskÃÂÃÂ¶ldsvik, Sweden. ÃÂÃÂThis new contract modification for additional mortar vehicles ensures that soldiers will benefit from this critical capability in the near future,ÃÂÃÂ said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, managing director of BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds. ÃÂÃÂWe look forward to continuing to support the Swedish ArmyÃÂÃÂs efforts to modernize and increase its combat power.ÃÂÃÂ The original contract for 40 CV90 MjÃÂÃÂ¶lner systems was awarded in 2016, and deliveries of the systems started in 2019 and were completed on time in 2020. In February 2022, FMV awarded the first follow-on contract for 20 additional systems, as well as the upgrade of the 40 systems already in service, to bring them all to the same standard by integrating the Swedish ArmyÃÂÃÂs new C4I LSS Mark system. Both FMV and BAE Systems have heralded this program as a benchmark for collaborative development. Once the contract modification deliveries are completed in 2025, the Swedish Army will operate 80 CV90 mortar vehicles in its fleet. The vehicles, known as Granatkastarpansarbandvagn 90, provide critical indirect firepower capabilities in the mechanized brigades. There are approximately 1,300 CV90s, in multiple variants, in service with Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The vehicle has a combat-proven track record and is designed to accommodate future growth to meet evolving missions. More recently, both Slovakia and the Czech Republic have selected CV90 to replace their legacy infantry fighting vehicle fleets.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230126005876/en/BAE-Systems-Receives-Contract-for-20-Additional-CV90-Mj%C3%B6lner-Mortar-Systems-for-Swedish-Army,businesswire.com,5,rnskldsvik swedenbusiness wirebae system received contract modification swedish defence materiel administration fmv build additional cv mortar vehicle approximately million contract awarded bae system swedish joint venture hb utveckling ab combine bae system hgglunds bofors manufacturing capability production performed bae system hgglunds rnskldsvik sweden new contract modification additional mortar vehicle ensures soldier benefit critical capability near future said tommy gustafssonrask managing director bae system hgglunds look forward continuing support swedish army effort modernize increase combat power original contract cv mjlner system awarded delivery system started completed time february fmv awarded first followon contract additional system well upgrade system already service bring standard integrating swedish army new ci lss mark system fmv bae system heralded program benchmark collaborative development contract modification delivery completed swedish army operate cv mortar vehicle fleet vehicle known granatkastarpansarbandvagn provide critical indirect firepower capability mechanized brigade approximately cv multiple variant service denmark estonia finland norway sweden switzerland netherlands vehicle combatproven track record designed accommodate future growth meet evolving mission recently slovakia czech republic selected cv replace legacy infantry fighting vehicle fleet,0.9186,0.4593,0.10717,0.35213,Positive Impact

Der Auftragswert belÃÂÃÂ¤uft sich auf 22 Billionen SEK (2,2 Billionen $). Im Zuge der Vereinbarung erhalten die tschechischen Soldaten hochleistungsfÃÂÃÂ¤hige Fahrzeuge und die tschechische Industrie ist maÃÂÃÂgeblich an dem Programm beteiligt. ÃÂÃÂAls neuntes Mitglied der CV90 User Group werden die Tschechische Republik und ihre Armee von diesem kampferprobten SchÃÂÃÂ¼tzenpanzer, der eine herausragende Kombination aus MobilitÃÂÃÂ¤t, Feuerkraft, Schutz und zukÃÂÃÂ¼nftigem Wachstumspotenzial bietet, profitierenÃÂÃÂ, so Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, Managing Director von BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds in ÃÂÃÂrnskÃÂÃÂ¶ldsvik, Schweden. ÃÂÃÂDieser Vertrag ist zudem ein groÃÂÃÂer Gewinn fÃÂÃÂ¼r die tschechische Industrie, von dem sie ÃÂÃÂ¼ber Jahrzehnte profitieren wird.ÃÂÃÂ Die CV90 werden im Rahmen einer Industriepartnerschaft mit der tschechischen Industrie entwickelt und ausgeliefert, um den Anforderungen des tschechischen Verteidigungsministeriums und dem Ziel der Erhaltung der nationalen SouverÃÂÃÂ¤nitÃÂÃÂ¤t der Tschechischen Republik gerecht zu werden. Die tschechischen Industriepartner werden 40 % des Beschaffungswertes in Form von Entwicklungs-, Produktions- und MontagevertrÃÂÃÂ¤gen (ohne Mehrwertsteuer) beisteuern. Das Programm erÃÂÃÂ¶ffnet der Industrie auch in Zukunft MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten, die weit ÃÂÃÂ¼ber den Vertragsabschluss mit den tschechischen Industriepartnern hinausgehen und einen erheblichen finanziellen Wert darstellen. Der Vertrag wird den lokalen Verteidigungssektor stÃÂÃÂ¤rken, da er den Zugang zur globalen Lieferkette von BAE Systems erÃÂÃÂ¶ffnet, die MÃÂÃÂ¶glichkeiten der Zusammenarbeit erweitert und die lokale WettbewerbsfÃÂÃÂ¤higkeit verbessert. Der CV90 MKIV, die neueste Generation des marktfÃÂÃÂ¼hrenden SchÃÂÃÂ¼tzenpanzers, ist ein ideales, kampferprobtes Fahrzeug. Der CV90 wurde weltweit in Koalitionsoperationen sowohl unter NATO- als auch unter UN-Mandat eingesetzt. Das Fahrzeug bietet ÃÂÃÂ¼berlegene taktische und strategische Eigenschaften zur BekÃÂÃÂ¤mpfung einer Vielzahl von Boden- und Luftzielen sowie eine auÃÂÃÂergewÃÂÃÂ¶hnliche WiderstandsfÃÂÃÂ¤higkeit in jedem GelÃÂÃÂ¤nde und taktischen Umfeld. BAE Systems HÃÂÃÂ¤gglunds hat ÃÂÃÂ¼ber 1.400 CV90 in 17 Varianten fÃÂÃÂ¼r europÃÂÃÂ¤ische LÃÂÃÂ¤nder produziert, darunter fÃÂÃÂ¼nf NATO-Mitglieder. Vor kurzem hat sich die Slowakei fÃÂÃÂ¼r den CV90 fÃÂÃÂ¼r ihre StreitkrÃÂÃÂ¤fte entschieden und ist damit neben der Tschechischen Republik das achte bzw. neunte Mitgliedsland der CV90 User Group.

Traditional space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) collection can be siloed, labor intensive, and unable to dynamically re-evaluate quickly enough to take advantage of new space systems. To address this, DARPA, the U.S. Space Force, and the Space Development Agency are developing satellite constellations to improve the tactical relevance of U.S. space systems. Proliferated low earth orbit satellite constellations are significantly expanding on-orbit ISR capabilities. The DARPA Oversight program will focus on creating an autonomous system that maintains constant ÃÂÃÂcustodyÃÂÃÂ of a large number of assets across new, diversified constellations. Under the terms of the program, the technology will be deployed to both tactical-edge satellites and ground stations. ÃÂÃÂRapidly advancing near-peer adversary capabilities are driving a need for additional long-range tracking at increased scale and timeliness,ÃÂÃÂ said Dr. John Grimes, director of Small Satellites at BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ FAST Labs. ÃÂÃÂTo meet this requirement, our team includes technical expertise in autonomy, space processing, ISR systems, tactical-edge software development, system integration and architectures, and mission focus.ÃÂÃÂ Work on the program, which is part of BAE SystemsÃÂÃÂ autonomous technologies portfolio, includes collaboration with subcontractors OmniTeq and AIMdyn, Inc.",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230525005243/en/BAE-Systems-to-develop-autonomous-space-based-surveillance-technology,businesswire.com,5,merrimack nhbusiness wirethe defense advanced research project agency darpa awarded bae system fast labstm research development organization million contract oversight autonomous spacebased target custody program traditional space intelligence surveillance reconnaissance isr collection siloed labor intensive unable dynamically reevaluate quickly enough take advantage new space system address darpa u space force space development agency developing satellite constellation improve tactical relevance u space system proliferated low earth orbit satellite constellation significantly expanding onorbit isr capability darpa oversight program focus creating autonomous system maintains constant custody large number asset across new diversified constellation term program technology deployed tacticaledge satellite ground station rapidly advancing nearpeer adversary capability driving need additional longrange tracking increased scale timeliness said dr john grime director small satellite bae system fast lab meet requirement team includes technical expertise autonomy space processing isr system tacticaledge software development system integration architecture mission focus work program part bae system autonomous technology portfolio includes collaboration subcontractor omniteq aimdyn inc,0.9371,0.46855,0.13965,0.3289,Positive Impact

Newer models, like the 5th generation F-22 Raptor play a key role in the Air Force. However, some of the top-used aircraft have been around since the 1970s and are still dominating the fleet. (Also see every fighter plane in the US Air Force for the past 90 years.) 24/7 Wall St. took a close look at all of the currently active combat aircraft within the U.S. Air Force. To identify every combat aircraft in service, we reviewed data from the 2024 World Air Forces report from FlightGlobal, an aviation and aerospace industry website. Aircraft are ranked by active unit, and weÃÂÃÂve included supplemental information on the aircraft type, top speed, and armament, excluding trainer aircraft. Here is a look at every combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force: Why Are We Covering This? Understanding the aircraft in the US Air Force is important because these aircraft play a pivotal role in maintaining national security and global stability. Each aircraft is designed for specific missions, from air superiority to strategic bombing and reconnaissance, which are essential for defending the country and projecting power abroad. Also knowing which aircraft are in service gives context to military capabilities and a better understanding of national defense. 16. B-21 Raider Type: Long range strategic stealth bomber Year introduced: Expected 2028 Active aircraft: 100 on order Top speed: 621 mph Armament: Conventional drop bombs, precision-guided bombs, nuclear-tipped bombs/missiles Within the next decade, the B-21 Raider is expected to enter service to augment the B-2 Spirit stealth bombers. It will be capable of carrying both conventional and precision-guided bombs, as well as nuclear-tipped bombs and missiles. So far 100 of these stealth bombers are on order, with test flights already having taken place within the past year. 15. Mi-171 Hip-H Type: Medium-lift transport helicopter Year introduced: 1981 Active aircraft: 1 Top speed: 158 mph Armament: Shturm missiles, rocket pods, 23mm cannon pods, 7.62mm machine guns Originally designed by the Soviets at the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant, this has been a staple for the Russian Air Force for years. While this is a widely used helicopter for many militaries around the world, the U.S. Air Force only has one. However, American engineering for other more advanced helicopters like the Black Hawk or Apache is more of a priority for the U.S. Air Force. 14. AC-130W Stinger II Type: Special operations fixed-wing gunship Year introduced: 2010 Active aircraft: 3 Top speed: 300 mph Armament: 30mm Bushmaster II GAU-23/A gatling gun, Viper Strike missiles, Griffin missiles, Hellfire missiles The Stinger II is a step up from the legacy AC-130 gunships, notably integrating advanced missile systems. Built by Lockheed Martin, this gunship only recently entered service in 2010. Armed with a 30mm Bushmaster II GAU-23/A gatling gun, along with Viper Strike, Griffin, and Hellfire missiles, The Stinger II is designed to deliver serious firepower in support of ground forces. 13.

AC-130J Ghostrider Type: Ground attack / close-air support Year introduced: 2017 Active aircraft: 29 Top speed: 416 mph Armament: 30mm ATK GAU-23/A automatic cannon, 105mm M102 field howitzer, Griffin missiles, Viper Strike precision-guided bombs, Hellfire missiles, drop bombs The Ghostrider is the latest in the AC-130 gunship series. Although these gunships do not carry nukes, they can equip practically any other ordnance even a gun meant for ground artillery. The Ghostrider is easily one of the most heavily armed aircraft in the U.S. Air Force. Most notably in GhostriderÃÂÃÂs arsenal is its 105mm howitzer, which is typically seen on ground artillery platforms. This big gun delivers serious firepower with pinpoint accuracy from far above the battlefield, giving it an incredible tactical advantage. Outside of the 105mm howitzer, Ghostrider can equip a variety of missiles like Hellfires or Griffins, precision-guided bombs, or even just the basic conventional drop bombs. 10. B-1B Lancer Type: Strategic heavy bomber Year introduced: 1986 Active aircraft: 42 Top speed: 833 mph Armament: Joint direct attack munitions, general purpose bombs, naval mines, cluster munitions, SRAM missiles, JASSM missiles, JSOW missiles, freefall nuclear bombs Introduced in 1986, the B-1B Lancer is a strategic heavy bomber that is capable of reaching speeds up to 833 mph, which makes it one of the fastest bombers in the U.S. Air Force.

CV-22 Osprey Type: Tilt rotor VTOL aircraft Year introduced: 2007 Active aircraft: 52 Top speed: 316 mph Armament: 7.62mm machine guns, 12.7mm machine guns Known for its unique ability to takeoff and land vertically like a helicopter and then adjust its rotors to operate like a turboprop plane, the CV-22 Osprey is one of the more unique aircraft in the U.S. Air Force. It is manufactured by Bell Boeing and plays key roles in U.S. special operations missions like infiltration, extraction, and resupply. The U.S. Marine Corps uses this aircraft extensively for troop deployment and extraction, or even just for logistical purposes. The Osprey also can refuel mid-flight which significantly extends its range for longer missions. 8. UH-1N Twin Huey Type: Multi-role utility helicopter Year introduced: 1970 Active aircraft: 64 Top speed: 150 mph Armament: 12.7mm GAU-16 machine gun, 7.62mm machine guns, 70mm rocket pods The UH-1N Twin Huey is a multi-role utility helicopter introduced in 1970, with a top speed of 150 mph and a wide range of armaments, including 12.7mm GAU-16 machine guns and 70mm rocket pods. It was manufactured by Bell Helicopter, and it has been widely used by the U.S. military since the 1970s. There have been many variations of the UH-1 Huey that span a number roles, but mainly combat. Other notable variants are the UH-1 Iroquois, UH-1Y Venom, and AH-1 Cobra. 7. B-52H Stratofortress Type: Long range strategic heavy bomber Year introduced: 1955 Active aircraft: 72 Top speed: 595 mph Armament: ACLM cruise missiles, Harpoon missiles, CALCM cruise missiles, joint direct attack munitions, freefall nuclear bombs The B-52 is one of the longest serving aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, introduced in 1955. It was originally developed in the post-World War II years to succeed the B-29 Superfortress, which dropped the bomb on Japan. The B-52s were designed to carry larger payloads than the B-29, including nuclear weapons. The Stratofortress acted as a strong nuclear deterrent throughout the Cold War as well. 6. S-70 Black Hawk Type: Medium-lift multi-mission helicopter Year introduced: 1979 Active aircraft: 96 Top speed: 183 mph Armament: 7.62mm machine guns, Hellfire missiles, 12.7mm gatling guns, M134 gatling guns, rocket pods, 30mm chain gun Black Hawk helicopters have played important roles in conflicts around the globe. One infamous instance was the conflict in Somalia in 1993, particularly the Battle of Mogadishu. The Black Hawk played a significant role in urban combat and casualty evacuation under intense fire. This story would go on to make it as a blockbuster movie famously titled ÃÂÃÂBlack Hawk Down.ÃÂÃÂ It is by far one of the most iconic helicopters ever built. It is the workhorse of the U.S. military with over a few thousand units currently in service across all branches. The Black Hawk features twin turboshaft engines, a single four-bladed main rotor, and a four-bladed tail rotor, which allow for top speeds over 180 mph. Typically, this helicopter carries a crew of two pilots and two crew chiefs and can transport up to 11 fully equipped soldiers. In total, the Black Hawk can carry a payload of roughly 9,000 pounds. 5. F-22 Raptor Type: 5th generation air dominance fighter aircraft Year introduced: 2005 Active aircraft: 178 Top speed: 1,599 mph Armament: 20mm automatic cannon, Sidewinder missiles, AMRAAM missiles, joint drop munitions, drop bombs, air-launched cruise missiles The F-22 Raptor is one of the elite fifth-generation aircraft, introduced in 2005. It features some of the newest stealth technology and can hit speeds around Mach 2. It comes equipped with a 20mm automatic cannon standard and can be outfitted with Sidewinder and AMRAAM missiles, as well as joint drop munitions and air-launched cruise missiles. In addition to its impressive speed and firepower, the F-22 Raptor is known for its unmatched agility and advanced avionics, making it a dominant force in both air superiority and strike missions. One interesting fact about this aircraft is that the RaptorÃÂÃÂs supercruise ability enables it to sustain high-speed flight without the need for afterburners. This sets it apart from most other fighters, which typically require afterburners to exceed the speed of sound. The F-22 Raptor can sustain speeds of Mach 1.5 to Mach 2 in supercruise mode. 4. F-35A Lightning II Type: Multirole 5th generation aircraft Year introduced: 2016 Active aircraft: 234 Top speed: 1,199 mph Armament: 25mm GAU-12/U automatic cannon, Sidewinder missiles, Paveway guided bombs, Rockeye II bombs, Brimstone missiles, Storm Shadow missiles, drop bombs Introduced in 2016, the F-35A Lightning II boasts a top speed of 1,199 mph and can equip a wide variety of weapons. It is one of the newest fifth-generation aircraft to enter the service. Currently, there are 234 in active service for the U.S. Air Force but hundreds more are on order from Lockheed Martin for the U.S. military at large. 3.

Built by Fairchild Republic, the A-10 is known for its toughness, earning its nickname as the ÃÂÃÂWarthogÃÂÃÂ. One aspect about the A-10 is its ÃÂÃÂtitanium bathtubÃÂÃÂ cockpit, which provides the pilot with protection from ground fire. 2. F-15 C/E/EX Eagle II Type: Air superiority fighter aircraft Year introduced: 1976 Active aircraft: 377 Top speed: 1,875 mph Armament: 20mm M61A1 automatic cannon, Sidewinder missiles, Sparrow missiles, Maverick missiles, HARM missiles, laser-guided bombs, joint direct attack munitions, cluster bombs, nuclear bombs Developed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) in the 1970s, the F-15 Eagle and Strike Eagle variant stand as some of the most iconic and successful fighter jets in the world. With a top speed over Mach 2, the F-15 can outrun almost anything in the sky. Its twin-engine design provides serious thrust, allowing some variants to carry over 16,000 pounds of ordnance, including air-to-air missiles and bombs. One thing that stands out with this jet is its combat record. Since its introduction, the F-15 has claimed more than 100 air-to-air victories without a single loss in combat. The F-15 has been used in several conflicts, including Operation Desert Storm, where it proved its air superiority by downing numerous Iraqi aircraft. The Strike Eagle has seen extensive combat as well, especially in ground-attack operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. 1.

Should this sale go through, it would be the first sale of these fifth-generation jets to an ally for China. The J-35 is incredibly stealthy. It has the ability to travel at high speeds up to Mach 2 (approximately 1,534 mph), has a high payload capacity, and is cheaper and easier to manufacture than some previous versions. The J-35 is also a prime example of how stealth aircraft design and capabilities have shifted over the years. When stealth technology was first conceptualized in World War I, the manufacturers had no idea how far the technology would come to this day. (You wonÃÂÃÂt believe how fast these military stealth planes fly.) Stealth aircraft are especially valuable for military forces because of their ability to evade radar detection. Along with advanced warfare systems and sensors, and new weapon capabilities, stealth planes allow militaries to gain a stronger understanding of who theyÃÂÃÂre up against ÃÂÃÂ and strike first, should the need arise. While some countries are still using stealth aircraft from decades ago, others have pivoted to more modern stealth planes. To identify the oldest and newest stealth planes in world militaries or on order, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the report 2023 World Air Forces from FlightGlobal, an aviation and aerospace industry website, as well as other sources. We ordered these stealth aircraft, including uncrewed aerial vehicles and aircraft on order, chronologically. Supplemental data regarding the type of aircraft, top speed, manufacturer, and armament came from Military Factory. Data on notable countries that operate these aircraft came from FlightGlobal. Why WeÃÂÃÂre Discussing Stealth Aircraft Covert air operations began in World War I with militaries attempting to reduce the visibility or sound of their aircraft. Technology in this regard has made leaps and bounds since the First World War. Companies that manufacture these jets for the military, like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), make billions in sales every year, and itÃÂÃÂs worth understanding how these companies operate if youÃÂÃÂre considering investing in them. Here are the oldest and most cutting-edge military aircraft still used to this day: 1.
