New to the report is a longer-dated lookback at investor activity over the last three years. The report, which analyzes proprietary data of U.S.-based investors who trade through introducing brokers on the Apex Clearing platform as of December 31, 2022, sheds light on the top 100 stocks1 held by investors across four generations, with a special focus on the millennial and rising Gen Z2 demographics. The report is not intended as securities analysis nor as a recommendation to buy or sell any investment and is meant for informational purposes only. Specific themes in the Q4 ANIO Report include: Millennials Take Stage as the Big Movers ÃÂÃÂ In Q4, Millennials executed nearly 56 million trades, more than any other generation and 1.4x the trades made by Gen X. Gen Z made the fewest moves overall, executing just over 9 million trades. Of investors who did execute trades in Q4, while many of them involved selling, a large minority of their positions had no sales and were increased with additional buying activity. Across generations, over 40% of positions that saw trading activity had buy activity only, with Gen Z having the lowest buy-only percentage of 37%.

Across generations, over 40% of positions that saw trading activity had buy activity only, with Gen Z having the lowest buy-only percentage of 37%. Investors Hold Amid Continued Recession Concerns ÃÂÃÂ The end of 2022 saw notable moves up and down the bottom half of the rankings, although the top stocksÃÂÃÂ Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT)ÃÂÃÂbarely budged. Each generation had a different set of significant shifts, but real estate investment trust AGNC Investment Corp (AGNC) advanced on all 4 generation lists with an average move of 21.8. Self-directed investors took a wait-and-see approach in Q4. A full 92% of their positions were held. Furthermore, 89% of self-directed investors executed no trades. On the other hand, managed investors generally held less and traded more.

On the other hand, managed investors generally held less and traded more. Industrials and Energy Sectors Favored Across Generations While Services Lose Steam ÃÂÃÂ The two strongest performing sectors in Q4 across the generational rankings, were industrials and energy, with 76.5% and 76.9% of their respective tickers moving up and only 17.6% and 19.2% moving down. Across all generational holdings, industrials were led by General Electric (GE), Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT), Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX), Boeing Co (BA), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), while energy stocks were led by namely Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), and followed closely by BP plc (BP), Energy Transfer LP Unit (ET), and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). The tickers that dropped the most in our Top 100 list include RIVN, which dipped an average of 27.8 spots across all generations, followed by AMC, which slipped an average of 11.8 spots. For three out of four generations ÃÂÃÂ Gen Z, millennials and Gen X ÃÂÃÂ businesses TTD, DKNG and RBLX also dropped the most, -27.7, -18.7, and -18.3, respectively.

Long-Time Leader TSLA Overtaken By AAPL ÃÂÃÂ After holding the number-one spot on the Top 100 Stocks, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) was finally unseated by Apple Inc. (AAPL) for Gen X and Gen Z. For Gen X, TSLA spent nine consecutive quarters in the top spot; for Gen Z, TSLA had a four-quarter streak. At number two, TSLA is still a beloved stockÃÂÃÂespecially with Millennials and Gen Z, who chose to hold at the highest rates, even as the price plummeted. For self-directed investors of all ages, the TSLA hold rate is significantly higher (93%) than for investors who use managed brokerage services (84%).

ÃÂÃÂAs a partner for the industryÃÂÃÂs leading online investing platforms, Apex has a unique view into the changing landscape of digital wealth management,ÃÂÃÂ said Connor Coughlin, Chief Commercial Officer, Fintech at Apex Fintech Solutions. ÃÂÃÂThroughout the fourth quarter 2022, retail investors displayed a risk-managed approach to trading and strategic investing as they continue to navigate recession fears. Millennials were the most active traders in the fourth quarter, demonstrating clear engagement and attention to evolving market conditions.ÃÂÃÂ Over the past few years, aggregate assets for all generations have risen ~16% to $52.4 trillion, while millennials and Gen Z are gaining wealth at a rate of 25%, much faster than the older generations.3 Such a massive shift in market power is fueling major implications for how, when, and why financial services are consumed today and in the future. In turn, for the first time, Apex included longer-duration data analysis to evaluate investor behavior during this period, deemed to be the ÃÂÃÂrise of the retail investor.ÃÂÃÂ The analysis found: Self-Directed vs. Managed Trends Lookback (Q1 2020 - Q2 2022) ÃÂÃÂ Compared to managed accounts, self-directed accounts did comparatively little selling at the lows of the stock market at the onset of the pandemic (early 2020). Instead, the peak in selling (the low for the hold rate) for self-directed came at the height of meme stock volatility in Q1 2021. Over the whole period, including when their rate of selling was at its highest, managed accounts consistently add to positions at a much higher rate than self-directed, who are more likely to enter a position only once or add to it fewer times. Specifically, year over year from EOY '21 to EOY '22 the top 10 stocks with the largest decline in the value of holdings held by self-directed investors were: Tesla Inc. (TSLA), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC), Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), NIO Inc. (NIO), Lucid Group Inc. (LCID), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR).

Overall, the report analyzed more than 1.3 million Gen Z accounts, in addition to over 4.0 million accounts held by Millennials, 2.0 million held by Gen X, and over half a million held by baby boomers. Apex defines generations according to the following: Generation Z Born: 1997-2012 Age in 2022: 25 and younger Born: 1997-2012 Age in 2022: 25 and younger Millennial Born: 1981-1996 Age in 2022: 26-41 Born: 1981-1996 Age in 2022: 26-41 Generation X Born: 1965-1980 Age in 2022: 42-57 Born: 1965-1980 Age in 2022: 42-57 Baby Boomer Born: 1946-1964 Age in 2022: 58-76 Born: 1946-1964 Age in 2022: 58-76 To download the full ANIO Report, click here.

Announces that a Class Action Lawsuit Has Been Filed Against Tesla, Inc. and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Tesla, Inc. (ÃÂÃÂTeslaÃÂÃÂ or the ÃÂÃÂCompanyÃÂÃÂ) (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Tesla securities between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ÃÂÃÂClass PeriodÃÂÃÂ). Investors have until April 28, 2023 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The CompanyÃÂÃÂs common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (ÃÂÃÂNASDAQÃÂÃÂ) under the ticker symbol ÃÂÃÂTSLAÃÂÃÂ. In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (ÃÂÃÂAutopilotÃÂÃÂ), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (ÃÂÃÂADASÃÂÃÂ) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the CompanyÃÂÃÂs ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called ÃÂÃÂFull Self-DrivingÃÂÃÂ (ÃÂÃÂFSDÃÂÃÂ) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the carÃÂÃÂs navigation system. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the CompanyÃÂÃÂs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the CompanyÃÂÃÂs Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to DefendantsÃÂÃÂ representations, TeslaÃÂÃÂs Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the CompanyÃÂÃÂs public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with ÃÂÃÂno oneÃÂÃÂ driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a ÃÂÃÂfieryÃÂÃÂ crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed ÃÂÃÂno one was drivingÃÂÃÂ the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021. On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (ÃÂÃÂNHTSAÃÂÃÂ) had opened a formal investigation into TeslaÃÂÃÂs Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021. On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022. On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (ÃÂÃÂCEOÃÂÃÂ), Defendant Elon R. Musk (ÃÂÃÂMuskÃÂÃÂ), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023. On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the CompanyÃÂÃÂs FSD ÃÂÃÂBetaÃÂÃÂ software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act ÃÂÃÂin an unlawful or unpredictable manner,ÃÂÃÂ increasing the risk of a crash. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023. Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in TeslaÃÂÃÂs vehicles. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day. As a result of DefendantsÃÂÃÂ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the CompanyÃÂÃÂs common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses. What is this Case About: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Misstated the Efficacy, Viability, and Safety of the Company's Autopilot and FSD Technologies According to the complaint, in 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot, a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (""ADAS"") features including automated lane-centering traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to support the ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called ""Full Self-Driving"" (""FSD"") software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car's navigation system. During the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) they had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company's Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to their representations, Tesla's Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury; and (iii) this subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm. On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") had opened a formal investigation into Tesla's Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that the NHTSA issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause. Then, on January 27, 2023, media outlets reported the SEC was investigating statements by Elon Musk concerning the Autopilot system, including whether he had made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system. On this news, Tesla's stock fell over 6%. On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that the NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the CompanyÃÂÃÂs FSD ÃÂÃÂBetaÃÂÃÂ software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act ÃÂÃÂin an unlawful or unpredictable manner,ÃÂÃÂ increasing the risk of a crash. On this news, Tesla's stock fell 5.69%. Finally, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles because of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in TeslaÃÂÃÂs vehicles. On this news, Tesla's stock price fell $10.94, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (ÃÂÃÂAutopilotÃÂÃÂ), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (ÃÂÃÂADASÃÂÃÂ) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, Tesla has touted refinements and enhancements to TeslaÃÂÃÂs ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called ÃÂÃÂFull Self-DrivingÃÂÃÂ (ÃÂÃÂFSDÃÂÃÂ) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the carÃÂÃÂs navigation system. The Tesla class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Tesla had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of TeslaÃÂÃÂs Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to TeslaÃÂÃÂs representations, TeslaÃÂÃÂs Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; and (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action. On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with ÃÂÃÂno oneÃÂÃÂ driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a ÃÂÃÂfieryÃÂÃÂ crash. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 3%. Then, on August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (ÃÂÃÂNHTSAÃÂÃÂ) had opened a formal investigation into TeslaÃÂÃÂs Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 4%. Thereafter, on June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 9%. Further, on January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer, defendant Elon Musk, concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 6%. Then, on February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with TeslaÃÂÃÂs FSD ÃÂÃÂBetaÃÂÃÂ software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act ÃÂÃÂin an unlawful or unpredictable manner,ÃÂÃÂ increasing the risk of a crash. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 5%. Finally, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. On this news, TeslaÃÂÃÂs stock price declined more than 5%, further damaging investors. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Tesla common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Tesla class action lawsuit.

A large emergency response was reported early Wednesday off of Archer Avenue, close to Interstate 355 in Lemont. Will County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Kathy Hoffmeyer told Patch the incident happened at 2:11 a.m. on Wednesday. Initially, Lemont Police and Cook County Sheriff's Office responded to single-vehicle crash of a Tesla Model 3, as well as Homer Fire Department. The fire department extricated the 34-year-old driver from the vehicle. The front seat passenger, a 36-year-old man, was pronounced deceased, according to the sheriff's office. The Will County Coroner's Office has identified him as Sameer Gowani, of Lisle. The driver was taken to the hospital in stable condition. The backseat passenger was ejected from the vehicle and airlifted to the hospital in critical condition, Hoffmeyer said. Hoffmeyer said the vehicle was heading eastbound on 135th Street at a high rate of speed, and lost control while maneuvering the curve west of Archer Avenue. ""The vehicle crossed over the double yellow line into oncoming westbound traffic, struck the curb on the north side of the roadway,"" Hoffmeyer said. ""The vehicle then went airborne, touching down in a grassy area near the entrance of the Target store.
